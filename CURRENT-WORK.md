## 5PM emergency senior expansion — ACTIVE until 2026-09-21 17:00 Africa/Accra

Owner/user explicitly authorizes a bounded same-day expansion so production-MVP usability defects #82, #83 and #84 can be resolved in parallel before the 17:00 deadline. This is a temporary task-specific reassignment only and does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

```

This block explicitly overrides the earlier temporary R9 line `forbidden: #82–#88 implementation` **only for #82, #83 and #84 during this emergency window**. Historical ownership/provenance before this authorization remains historical and must not be rewritten.

Updated 2026-09-20. Canonical repo `WB-DevWorld/cetech-pwa-pos`. Historical scheduler detail remains in Git/PR/evidence history. This file controls current assignment and implementation authority.

## Temporary senior R9 reconciliation — ACTIVE

Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes reconciling accepted protected main plus the unmerged R10 post-merge ledger closeout into existing R9 / PR #63 so the candidate inherits current truth without merging `ws3/r10-prep-close` to protected main first. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. Historical R10 closeout evidence below remains retained.

Keep PR #63 DRAFT until genuine installed-client / reconnect / multi-tab / operational-close runtime evidence exists. Do not ask Ben for final milestone approval yet. A source review may be requested after the candidate is frozen.

Ben / `@Ben-001-sys` submitted CHANGES_REQUESTED on exact head `51c2c9bf0148d04113090565585fad3a4c7c2371`. The current slice is a bounded review-fix of SHA `BUILD_ID` minimum-version deadlock only. Do not start installed-device evidence until Ben confirms the source fix. Do not request Emmanuel.

## Temporary senior R10 Prep reconciliation — MERGED / PREPARATION COMPLETE / CONSUMED INTO R9

PR #79 squash-merged 2026-09-20T13:11:06Z. Source SHA: `bb35b8790e1370bc1b0aed6f39fc73c92549019a`. Resulting protected main: `c49045dd02c46574af5d341cc65c177116fa7306`. Ben / `@Ben-001-sys` APPROVED that exact head. This is qualification **preparation** only. QA-01 / #29 and REL-01 / #30 remain OPEN. R10 GO/NO-GO remains NO-GO. Production remains unauthorized. Follow-ups #82–#88 remain separate. Next active task is PR #63 R9 reconciliation; do not start it in this closeout. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

Historical lease (unchanged): Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes reconciling accepted REC-01 main into existing R10 Prep / PR #79 so Ben reviews current main plus the QA/release qualification framework, not obsolete `1399a8fac...`. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. REC-01 application source and CD-01 exact-SHA Preview infrastructure are already on protected main and are inherited here by a zero-overlap two-parent merge.

Do not ask Ben to review obsolete `1399a8fac...`. Request review only on the replacement exact head after CI-green qualification. Do not merge PR #79 from this assignment. This historical instruction is closed by the squash merge above.

## Temporary senior REC-01 main-reconciliation — MERGED / CLOSED

PR #80 merged 2026-09-20T12:27:52Z. Accepted source SHA: `6995e1c2324432e4cba234f6844bcb224e3d7a57`. Resulting protected main: `7c5d6ca0cd93d7aeb5a7a1c97153ca187548c3fb`. REC-01 application acceptance PASS for the behavior actually exercised. Follow-ups #82–#88 are separate and must not reopen REC-01. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

Historical lease (unchanged): Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes reconciling merged CD-01 exact-SHA Preview main into existing REC-01 / PR #80 so Ben reviews current main plus REC-01, not obsolete `7e9da309...`. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. CD-01 Preview infrastructure is already on protected main and is inherited here by a zero-overlap two-parent merge.

Do not ask Ben to review obsolete `7e9da309...`. Request review only on the replacement exact head after CI-green qualification.

## Temporary senior CD-01 exact-SHA Preview authority — MERGED / INHERITED

Merged to protected main as `c1f659ea118a885180fe6a543797efa908abf210` (PR #81 squash, 2026-09-19T19:57:06Z). REC-01 / PR #80 is now also merged. Exact-SHA Preview infrastructure is accepted; dispatch remains a later authorized action and is not production promotion. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

## Temporary senior CD-01 exact-SHA Preview authority — HISTORICAL (merged as c1f659ea)

Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes this bounded WS3 infrastructure/security extension so REC-01 can be qualified on an immutable Vercel Preview without merging the candidate. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. Authority is task-specific and expires at CD-01 exact-SHA Preview merge/handoff or explicit senior close.

This assignment is required because GitHub Actions Staging CD deploys only CI-green `main`, while unmerged same-repository candidates still need a trusted Preview path. Candidate source is never built in GitHub Actions with `VERCEL_TOKEN`; Vercel executes it remotely in Preview, so exact-head independent review remains required before any Vercel deployment request.

## Temporary senior STG-01 final review-fix — MERGED / CLOSED / HISTORICAL

STG-01 / PR #77 was accepted onto protected main as `c320be8c5ad41c190200381cd52f853dd95212dc`. This lease is no longer current assignment authority. Later accepted main advances: CD-01 `c1f659ea118a885180fe6a543797efa908abf210`, REC-01 `7c5d6ca0cd93d7aeb5a7a1c97153ca187548c3fb`. Do not reuse.

Historical lease (unchanged): Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes Cursor working with the senior/user to make ONLY the minimum WS3 + WS2 changes required to resolve Ben's two exact review blockers on exact reviewed head `33d3748b525dfea2e4979e58e795516df27aa552`, directly on existing `batch/stg-01-staging-runtime-acceptance` / PR #77.

## Temporary senior UX-04 review-fix — EXPIRED / CLOSED

Bounded review remediation on existing `ws1/ux-04-operational-workspaces-demo-alignment` from reviewed SHA `b36720093477f38e58f3cfc1132da8aa61887ffe`. Senior/user `@wbdevworld` reauthorized only the minimum existing UX-04 WS1/WS3/WS2 read paths to (1) recover the same payment/sale identity from Needs Attention Check / Recover and (2) stop customer search from replacing the local customer cache, plus truthful name/company/phone search. This does not permanently change `OWNERSHIP.md`. Do not reuse. Do not create another feature branch. Do not mutate PR #77 or `batch/stg-01-staging-runtime-acceptance`. Do not merge main.

- Follow-ups #82–#88 remain separate and are not started here.
- Issue #4 remains OPEN; `pricingParityVerified=false`.
- Production remains unauthorized.
- Live electronic payment, real refund/restock and VitePOS cutover remain independently gated.

  refund/restock
  VitePOS cutover
  closing QA-01 #29
  closing REL-01 #30

This historical closeout did not modify PR #63. It is now consumed as R9 ancestry; R9 is the current assignment.

## Historical STG-06 / R8 authority (retained, not current)

- historical accepted `main` at that time: `778348c0bcf2f3cef5280cf6cf7a1d057aa8f9e5` — squash-merged `[R8] Safe returns and payment/register states (#69)`.
- STG-01 candidate observed on `origin/batch/stg-01-staging-runtime-acceptance` at STG-06 freshness cutoff: `a02cd21875d0717adb6694d293b41575302b2415` (forward from previously recorded `4e47a1f793bb8b75f6cf4fa03ee8f66675b4a897` by STG-02 route persistence + docs correction; that contributor branch already started at that SHA).
- STG-02 route persistence docs-corrected head: `a02cd21875d0717adb6694d293b41575302b2415` on `ws3/stg-02-route-session-persistence`. That STG-06 contributor branch started exactly there.
- Issue #4 remained OPEN; `pricingParityVerified=false`. Production promotion, live Paystack, real refund/restock and VitePOS deactivation were not authorized.
- R9 PR #63 remained draft / must not merge while STG-01 was still open.

Senior instruction 2026-09-18 authorized that WS3 contributor branch from the exact SHA above. It is not current assignment authority.

## STG-01 recovery context (historical, retained)

This snapshot records the pre-acceptance STG-01 recovery state. STG-01 / #70, CORE-06 / #25 and R6 / #54 were later accepted via PR #77 / main `c320be8c5ad41c190200381cd52f853dd95212dc` and are not current open recovery gates.

- latest successful shared staging for merged main remains historical; application-runtime acceptance was gated on STG-01 / #70 plus this live navigation fix.
- CORE-06 / #25 and R6 / #54 remained reopened until isolated-staging runtime evidence existed.
- STG-02 original composition branch `ws3/stg-02-session-runtime-composition` established real session/CSRF/register authority. That assignment did not rewrite that; it persisted that runtime across App Router navigations.


## Historical STG-01 assignments (accepted; not current authority)

### WS3 / @wbdevworld

1. **STG-02 / #71 — staff session, CSRF and authoritative register state**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-02-session-runtime-composition`
   - remove hard-coded `Staff member` / `shiftOpen=true` authority;
   - establish real transitional staff session through the existing identity abstraction and `/api/pos/v1/session`;
   - preserve exact-origin CSRF and server authorization;
   - drive cashier/register/shift UI from authoritative server state.

2. **STG-04 / #73 — training Woo catalog projection**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-04-training-catalog-projection`
   - staging must stop treating `CASHIER_SEED_CATALOG` as operational truth;
   - local/test/demo may retain synthetic fixtures;
   - staging consumes a provider-derived, rebuildable IndexedDB projection;
   - Woo remains commerce truth; quote pricing remains bridge/Woo/B2BKing/WoodMart owned.

3. **STG-06 / #75 — functional staging acceptance gate**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-06-functional-staging-gate`
   - root HTTP smoke remains necessary but is not application acceptance;
   - acceptance must prove real session/CSRF, authoritative register state, real training projection, quote path and authorized synthetic cash-sale trace before #25/#54/#70 can close.

4. **STG-07 / #76 — CD summary audit fix**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-07-cd-summary-audit-fix`
   - fix Bash backtick command substitution in deployment summary without changing deployment semantics.

### WS2 boundary — task-specific implementation reassignment to @wbdevworld

**STG-05 / #74 — training Woo bridge producer/runtime**

- branch: `ws2/stg-05-training-bridge-runtime`
- original WS2 owner remains Emmanuel / `@Emmanuel-coder-prog`, but the senior authority explicitly reassigns implementation of this task to `@wbdevworld` for this remediation cycle because Emmanuel currently lacks SSH/repository implementation access.
- This does **not** transfer general WS2 ownership to WS3.
- Changes must remain inside STG-05's WS2-owned paths: `wordpress/cetech-pos-bridge/**`, `tests/bridge/**`, `tests/fixtures/commerce/**`, WS2 evidence/handoff.
- Do not mix WS2 bridge edits into STG-02/STG-04 branches.
- Emmanuel may still independently review the resulting GitHub PR; SSH is not required for review.

### WS1 / @Ben-001-sys

1. **STG-03 / #72**
   - branch: `ws1/stg-03-approved-workspaces`
   - implement approved production-intent Orders, Customers and Settings feature/UI surfaces;
   - do not edit provider/server/core/local logic.

2. **FE-07 / #12** remains canonical for Store Health, Attention/recovery, update/offline/degraded/passive-tab/migration UI.

Ben publishes exact tested source SHAs + mount instructions. WS3 mounts accepted WS1 components during STG-01 integration; integration ownership does not transfer WS1 implementation ownership.

## Integration order

1. STG-02 real session/CSRF/register composition.
2. STG-05 bridge producer verification/minimal repair (may run in parallel with STG-02; keep separate branch/path ownership).
3. STG-04 training catalog projection consumes the verified STG-05 producer boundary.
4. Ben delivers STG-03 + FE-07 source SHAs.
5. Integration editor imports only declared tested owner/reassigned-owner commits into `batch/stg-01-staging-runtime-acceptance`, preserving source SHA → imported SHA → tested combined SHA provenance.
6. Mount accepted WS1 features in WS3-owned app composition; no accepted route may fall through to the generic R4 placeholder.
7. Apply STG-07 audit fix.
8. Implement/run STG-06 functional staging acceptance against the exact immutable Vercel deployment produced from the candidate.
9. Capture redacted exact-SHA staging evidence; independent human review; final ADR-012 freshness procedure.
10. Only after all STG-01 gates pass may #25, #54 and #70 close and R9 resume.

## Imported provenance (this integration head)

Do not treat STG-04 contributor `CURRENT-WORK.md` as the shared ledger.

WS3 composition (mount + session/catalog keep-both): `6df4e1edc503aa2ab0fe37f2f26a9177e6726177`. Combined tested SHA is recorded in WS3 HANDOFF after the e2e-isolation commit; it is not self-embedded here.

Semantic conflict: `apps/pos-web/src/app/pos-app.tsx` and `apps/pos-web/src/config/env.ts` plus WS3 STATUS/HANDOFF. Composition keeps STG-02 staff/CSRF/register authority and STG-04 catalog projection. `readPublicStaffAuthEnv` and `readAppEnv` both remain. Staging still never silently seeds `CASHIER_SEED_CATALOG`. Ben Orders has no frozen list port: mounted empty/unavailable, no Woo from UI, no invented contract.

## Safety boundaries

- No production promotion.
- No live electronic payment execution.
- No real customer refund/restock.
- No VitePOS deactivation.
- Training/staging effects must remain inside CP-04 authorization.
- No secrets in prompts, commits, screenshots, logs or evidence.
- No wildcard origin/CSRF bypass.
- Do not clear IndexedDB/drafts/journal as a routine recovery or catalog-sync technique.
