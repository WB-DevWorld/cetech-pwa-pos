```

Current R9 PR #63 remains DRAFT. Existing R9 evidence is preserved. Final ADR-012/FRESH_2 and final R9 milestone review are paused until #105 is independently reviewed, integrated and runtime-accepted.

Shift and cash oversight is complete on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109. It is a read-only Management view over existing `pos_shifts` aggregates.

Returns, approvals, and requires-attention oversight is complete on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109. It is a Management view over existing return, refund, stock-disposition, and pending-operation records. It does not invent Approved or Rejected statuses, issue a new refund, or restock. An operational manager at the return location can bind an audited approval for an `approval_required` return. An operational manager at the refund location can check that existing refund through the existing reconciliation path. Organization Owner or Admin authority does not grant either action by itself.

Receipt settings administration is complete on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109. It reuses location-scoped `pos_receipt_settings` and `ReceiptSettings`. Owner and Admin may change settings through the still-unreleased `20260922123000_pos_admin_control_plane.sql` atomic RPC, which also appends `pos_admin_audit_events`. That migration has not been applied to staging or production, so the receipt-settings function was added there instead of as a later migration. Managers can view managed locations only.

System health is complete on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109. It is a read-only Management view over the existing store, commerce-connection, and commerce-contract checks. Owner, Admin, Manager, and Support may read it. Cashiers stay on the existing staff health route.

Audit browser is complete on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109. It is a bounded read-only view over append-only `pos_admin_audit_events`. Owner, Admin, and Support may read organization-wide events; operational managers may read only events tied to verified managed locations. Raw before/after JSON is not exposed to the browser.

## Temporary senior #105 cashier-boundary cleanup — COMPLETE

Owner/user's 2026-09-22 instruction to continue #105 authorizes this bounded task-specific reassignment so step 9 can remove technical/admin/support diagnostics from ordinary cashier surfaces. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. Ben / `@Ben-001-sys` remains the independent reviewer of the frozen #105 head.

Cashier diagnostics cleanup is source-complete on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109. Ordinary cashier Settings/System status no longer expose raw build/API/schema/quote diagnostics or repair controls; safe R9 local-recovery and update-safety behavior remains intact. System status is reached from Settings rather than primary cashier navigation.

## Temporary senior #105 source closeout — COMPLETE

Owner/user's 2026-09-22 instruction to finish #105 authorizes this bounded task-specific reassignment for the remaining source candidate. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. Ben / `@Ben-001-sys` remains the independent reviewer of the frozen #105 head.

```

#105 exact head `054e386fe13360f255fb44fdfc37cec7fcfe4218` passed source review, exact-SHA Preview identity, and staging database acceptance. The final UI/language audit reopened only a bounded Management presentation remediation: missing Staff/Policy layout styles, compact responsive navigation, 44px Management touch targets, operator-facing Management copy, and CI-running Management viewport tests. Business authorization/accounting/return/payment/PWA semantics remain frozen. The staging `pos_admin_control_plane` migration is already applied; production remains untouched. This remediation requires fresh exact-head CI and a new independent Ben review before runtime acceptance resumes. R9 remains paused.

The inherited operational policy includes `returnApprovalRequired` (default false). Return preview resolves it server-side at organization → location → register scope. Staging and production do not fall back to an ephemeral policy store. An operational manager binds an atomic, audited, replay-safe approval. The cashier continues the same stored return; the server matches return id and fingerprint and does not require a pasted approval id. Approval does not refund or change stock. `pos_returns.status` stays `approval_required` until existing return execution advances it.

Manager register assignment can change registers only for operational staff already assigned at a location the manager manages. It cannot change the operational role, add a location, invite, disable, or change Owner/Admin/Support membership. Owner and Admin keep full assignment management.

Cash correction reuses the existing exact-reversal rule: the signed amount is the negative of the original movement, the original row is unchanged, a correction cannot correct a correction, and expected cash moves only through the existing insert trigger. A manager at the shift location supplies a reason. Owner or Admin authority alone does not reverse cash.

Management X report is the live expected-cash view and is not stored. Z report reads the durable closed report and is not recalculated. Shift close controls on the register follow effective policy; the server close command remains the final gate.

## 5PM bounded UX-01 cashier-copy slice — ACTIVE until 2026-09-21 17:00 Africa/Accra

Owner/user explicitly authorizes only this narrow #78 slice for today's release candidate.

## SALE-RECOVERY-01 — explicit original-order repair and truthful recovery feedback

Owner report on 2026-10-03: “IT'S NOT RESOLVING”, with the installed-client Needs attention sale-recovery screen. Existing urgent direction requires fixing discovered tester defects while preserving the same tester origin. This is a new bounded WS3 recovery task; the expired receipt-only release exception is not general approval for this task.

Source implementation is complete on the bounded recovery branch, preserving the pinned UI/receipt baseline. The [recovery evidence](docs/testing/sale-recovery-2026-10-03/README.md) records original command/attempt preservation, lost-response handoff, first-write-wins persistence, reservation/payment guards, contributor provenance and verification limits. No live sale repair or staging rollout has occurred. Contributor source leases are released after root import; root retains qualification/handoff only. Final remote head, exact-head CI and bounded freshness observations belong in the PR handoff. Different-human review or an explicit owner exception for this candidate remains pending.

## 5PM emergency senior expansion — ACTIVE until 2026-09-21 17:00 Africa/Accra

Owner/user explicitly authorizes a bounded same-day expansion so production-MVP usability defects #82, #83 and #84 can be resolved in parallel before the 17:00 deadline. This is a temporary task-specific reassignment only and does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

This block explicitly overrides the earlier temporary R9 line `forbidden: #82–#88 implementation` **only for #82, #83 and #84 during this emergency window**. Historical ownership/provenance before this authorization remains historical and must not be rewritten.

Updated 2026-09-20. Canonical repo `WB-DevWorld/cetech-pwa-pos`. Historical scheduler detail remains in Git/PR/evidence history. This file controls current assignment and implementation authority.

## Temporary senior R9 reconciliation — ACTIVE

Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes reconciling accepted protected main plus the unmerged R10 post-merge ledger closeout into existing R9 / PR #63 so the candidate inherits current truth without merging `ws3/r10-prep-close` to protected main first. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. Historical R10 closeout evidence below remains retained.

## Temporary senior R10 Prep reconciliation — MERGED / PREPARATION COMPLETE / CONSUMED INTO R9

PR #79 squash-merged 2026-09-20T13:11:06Z. Source SHA: `bb35b8790e1370bc1b0aed6f39fc73c92549019a`. Resulting protected main: `c49045dd02c46574af5d341cc65c177116fa7306`. Ben / `@Ben-001-sys` APPROVED that exact head. This is qualification **preparation** only. QA-01 / #29 and REL-01 / #30 remain OPEN. R10 GO/NO-GO remains NO-GO. Production remains unauthorized. Follow-ups #82–#88 remain separate. Next active task is PR #63 R9 reconciliation; do not start it in this closeout. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

Historical lease (unchanged): Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes reconciling accepted REC-01 main into existing R10 Prep / PR #79 so Ben reviews current main plus the QA/release qualification framework, not obsolete `1399a8fac...`. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. REC-01 application source and CD-01 exact-SHA Preview infrastructure are already on protected main and are inherited here by a zero-overlap two-parent merge.

## Temporary senior CD-01 exact-SHA Preview authority — MERGED / INHERITED

Merged to protected main as `c1f659ea118a885180fe6a543797efa908abf210` (PR #81 squash, 2026-09-19T19:57:06Z). REC-01 / PR #80 is now also merged. Exact-SHA Preview infrastructure is accepted; dispatch remains a later authorized action and is not production promotion. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`.

## Temporary senior CD-01 exact-SHA Preview authority — HISTORICAL (merged as c1f659ea)

Senior/user `@wbdevworld` authorizes this bounded WS3 infrastructure/security extension so REC-01 can be qualified on an immutable Vercel Preview without merging the candidate. This does **not** permanently alter `OWNERSHIP.md`. Authority is task-specific and expires at CD-01 exact-SHA Preview merge/handoff or explicit senior close.

This assignment is required because GitHub Actions Staging CD deploys only CI-green `main`, while unmerged same-repository candidates still need a trusted Preview path. Candidate source is never built in GitHub Actions with `VERCEL_TOKEN`; Vercel executes it remotely in Preview, so exact-head independent review remains required before any Vercel deployment request.

## STG-01 recovery context (historical, retained)

This snapshot records the pre-acceptance STG-01 recovery state. STG-01 / #70, CORE-06 / #25 and R6 / #54 were later accepted via PR #77 / main `c320be8c5ad41c190200381cd52f853dd95212dc` and are not current open recovery gates.

- latest successful shared staging for merged main remains historical; application-runtime acceptance was gated on STG-01 / #70 plus this live navigation fix.
- CORE-06 / #25 and R6 / #54 remained reopened until isolated-staging runtime evidence existed.
- STG-02 original composition branch `ws3/stg-02-session-runtime-composition` established real session/CSRF/register authority. That assignment did not rewrite that; it persisted that runtime across App Router navigations.


## Historical STG-01 assignments (accepted; not current authority)

### WS3 / @wbdevworld

1. **STG-02 / #71 — staff session, CSRF and authoritative register state**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-02-session-runtime-composition`
   - remove hard-coded `Staff member` / `shiftOpen=true` authority;
   - establish real transitional staff session through the existing identity abstraction and `/api/pos/v1/session`;
   - preserve exact-origin CSRF and server authorization;
   - drive cashier/register/shift UI from authoritative server state.

2. **STG-04 / #73 — training Woo catalog projection**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-04-training-catalog-projection`
   - staging must stop treating `CASHIER_SEED_CATALOG` as operational truth;
   - local/test/demo may retain synthetic fixtures;
   - staging consumes a provider-derived, rebuildable IndexedDB projection;
   - Woo remains commerce truth; quote pricing remains bridge/Woo/B2BKing/WoodMart owned.

3. **STG-06 / #75 — functional staging acceptance gate**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-06-functional-staging-gate`
   - root HTTP smoke remains necessary but is not application acceptance;
   - acceptance must prove real session/CSRF, authoritative register state, real training projection, quote path and authorized synthetic cash-sale trace before #25/#54/#70 can close.

4. **STG-07 / #76 — CD summary audit fix**
   - branch: `ws3/stg-07-cd-summary-audit-fix`
   - fix Bash backtick command substitution in deployment summary without changing deployment semantics.

### WS2 boundary — task-specific implementation reassignment to @wbdevworld

**STG-05 / #74 — training Woo bridge producer/runtime**

- branch: `ws2/stg-05-training-bridge-runtime`
- original WS2 owner remains Emmanuel / `@Emmanuel-coder-prog`, but the senior authority explicitly reassigns implementation of this task to `@wbdevworld` for this remediation cycle because Emmanuel currently lacks SSH/repository implementation access.
- This does **not** transfer general WS2 ownership to WS3.
- Changes must remain inside STG-05's WS2-owned paths: `wordpress/cetech-pos-bridge/**`, `tests/bridge/**`, `tests/fixtures/commerce/**`, WS2 evidence/handoff.
- Do not mix WS2 bridge edits into STG-02/STG-04 branches.
- Emmanuel may still independently review the resulting GitHub PR; SSH is not required for review.

### WS1 / @Ben-001-sys

1. **STG-03 / #72**
   - branch: `ws1/stg-03-approved-workspaces`
   - implement approved production-intent Orders, Customers and Settings feature/UI surfaces;
   - do not edit provider/server/core/local logic.

2. **FE-07 / #12** remains canonical for Store Health, Attention/recovery, update/offline/degraded/passive-tab/migration UI.

Ben publishes exact tested source SHAs + mount instructions. WS3 mounts accepted WS1 components during STG-01 integration; integration ownership does not transfer WS1 implementation ownership.

## Integration order

1. STG-02 real session/CSRF/register composition.
2. STG-05 bridge producer verification/minimal repair (may run in parallel with STG-02; keep separate branch/path ownership).
3. STG-04 training catalog projection consumes the verified STG-05 producer boundary.
4. Ben delivers STG-03 + FE-07 source SHAs.
5. Integration editor imports only declared tested owner/reassigned-owner commits into `batch/stg-01-staging-runtime-acceptance`, preserving source SHA → imported SHA → tested combined SHA provenance.
6. Mount accepted WS1 features in WS3-owned app composition; no accepted route may fall through to the generic R4 placeholder.
7. Apply STG-07 audit fix.
8. Implement/run STG-06 functional staging acceptance against the exact immutable Vercel deployment produced from the candidate.
9. Capture redacted exact-SHA staging evidence; independent human review; final ADR-012 freshness procedure.
10. Only after all STG-01 gates pass may #25, #54 and #70 close and R9 resume.

## Imported provenance (this integration head)

Do not treat STG-04 contributor `CURRENT-WORK.md` as the shared ledger.

WS3 composition (mount + session/catalog keep-both): `6df4e1edc503aa2ab0fe37f2f26a9177e6726177`. Combined tested SHA is recorded in WS3 HANDOFF after the e2e-isolation commit; it is not self-embedded here.

Semantic conflict: `apps/pos-web/src/app/pos-app.tsx` and `apps/pos-web/src/config/env.ts` plus WS3 STATUS/HANDOFF. Composition keeps STG-02 staff/CSRF/register authority and STG-04 catalog projection. `readPublicStaffAuthEnv` and `readAppEnv` both remain. Staging still never silently seeds `CASHIER_SEED_CATALOG`. Ben Orders has no frozen list port: mounted empty/unavailable, no Woo from UI, no invented contract.

## Safety boundaries

- No production promotion.
- No live electronic payment execution.
- No real customer refund/restock.
- No VitePOS deactivation.
- Training/staging effects must remain inside CP-04 authorization.
- No secrets in prompts, commits, screenshots, logs or evidence.
- No wildcard origin/CSRF bypass.
- Do not clear IndexedDB/drafts/journal as a routine recovery or catalog-sync technique.

## Final #105 source remediation — IN SOURCE, NOT RUNTIME-ACCEPTED

The 2026-09-23 whole-system remediation stays on `ws3/admin-105-control-plane` / PR #109.
Starting remote head: `b5e70f6edd338428cc5e079db85ec4da45879645`.
It does not merge the PR, close #105, resume R9, promote production, or launch an Exact SHA Preview.

Source now includes one Settings navigation control, direct staff creation with a durable password-change gate, policy scope selection, server-owned payment-method capabilities, and owner/admin location, register, and device administration.
Location lifecycle uses forward migration `20260923140000_pos_admin_topology.sql`.
`20260922123000_pos_admin_control_plane.sql` stays unchanged because it is already applied on shared staging.

No persistent staging Owner was created. The next controlled runtime action is `docs/runbooks/ADMIN-105-FIRST-OWNER-BOOTSTRAP.md`.
Screen classification is `docs/workstreams/WS-03-CORE-DATA-INTEGRATION/evidence/ADMIN-105-SCREEN-CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md`.
Fresh `@Ben-001-sys` review is required for the exact final SHA. Older review does not carry forward.
## STAFF-QUOTE-132 — Urgent quote latency correction

Owner instruction, 2026-10-02 16:02 UTC: fix discovered defects immediately because testers are waiting, and serve the correction at the existing integration staging alias when they refresh. This bounded runtime task supersedes the earlier documentation-only freeze; it does not authorize production promotion or an integration/main merge.

```text
task: STAFF-QUOTE-132 / issue #132
editor: @wbdevworld / WS3 senior
branch: ws3/quote-latency-2026-10-02
application baseline: 1021cd113c783e25030fe9c0bda1be9ddcf5888c
allowed: src/app/pos-app.tsx, src/server/quotes/**,
  src/app/api/pos/v1/quotes/route.ts, focused tests,
  CURRENT-WORK.md, docs/integration/evidence/STAFF-QUOTE-132.md,
  current docs/staff documents and formatted reading copies
bounded consumer implementation delegation to this editor for this task:
  src/features/sell/runtime/{useCartQuote,pricingClient,quoteRequest,SellRuntimeScreen}.*,
  src/features/sell/{SellScreen.*,components/CartPanel.*,components/QuoteStatus.*},
  tests/frontend/sell-quote-runtime.test.ts, e2e/sell-runtime.spec.ts
forbidden: unrelated WS1/WS2 implementation, contract/migration/dependency changes,
  account/register/device/order/payment/refund/stock mutations,
  protected #102, production promotion, self-merge
source ownership: Woo owns prices; Supabase POS operations; local drafts/journal retained
contract/ADR changes: none; staff-documentation impact: yes
acceptance: equivalent cart inputs do not restart quotes; bounded failures and retry;
  current-cart/revision safety; timing evidence; same tester origin after deployment
independent integration review: required before any integration/main merge
```

Paths beginning `src/` or `e2e/` are relative to `apps/pos-web`. The consumer delegation is limited to the owner's urgent quote correction, not a transfer of general WS1 ownership. Upstream WordPress latency must remain open until live timings prove improvement. A timeout is not proof that pricing became fast.

## UI-REF-20261003 — owner-authorized UI refinement — REVIEW HANDOFF

Owner instruction, 2026-10-03 01:39 UTC: implement the UI changes discussed in this chat, with an 80-minute target and parallel agents as needed. This is an explicit bounded WS1 presentation reassignment to the senior/user implementing editor (@wbdevworld), expiring at review handoff. Existing source/reference bytes and commercial workflows remain intact.

- Branch: `ws1/ui-refinement-2026-10-03`.
- Baseline: deployed quote correction `2c7eb2ddeb22c3402d82673421a54dbe6ad236f1`; declared integration `1021cd113c783e25030fe9c0bda1be9ddcf5888c`.
- Allowed: non-receipt `apps/pos-web/src/ui/**`, `src/features/**`; focused frontend/e2e tests; this ledger, WS1 evidence/handoff and affected staff documentation. WS3 presentation-only composition in `src/app/globals.css` may be edited by the root integration editor if necessary.
- Parallel ownership: shell agent owns tokens/workspace/shell/toast/auth; Sell agent owns non-receipt Sell components/styles; operations agent owns Orders/Returns/Register/Customers; management agent owns non-receipt Management panels/styles; verification agent owns new refinement browser evidence/tests. Root alone owns docs/integration/composition and Settings outside receipt-owned controls. Each contributor has an isolated branch/worktree.
- Forbidden: receipt layout/settings/snapshot/print components and receipt CSS rules; core/server/local/config/contracts/migrations/dependencies/CI/service worker; WordPress bridge; main/protected branches; live commercial mutations; production promotion. Receipt work remains owned by `RECEIPT-REF-01` in its separate checkout.
- Canonical owners: Woo prices/orders/stock; Supabase POS operations; local drafts/journal remain preserved. Consumes existing v1 ports; no contract/migration/architecture changes.
- Acceptance: refined coherent visuals, usable responsive layouts, stable loading/error feedback, keyboard/touch accessibility, unchanged quote/payment/refund/shift/update safeguards; foundation/lint/typecheck/unit/build and relevant browser checks. Synthetic browser tests are not live payment/hardware proof.
- Staff documentation impact: yes; update current guide/workbook and formatted copies together after assembly.
- Independent exact-head human review remains required before integration/main merge. Publish a reviewable contributor candidate; do not self-merge. Staging deployment must use a qualified combined candidate that preserves any completed receipt handoff.

Implementation and local production verification are complete. Contributor leases are released after import. [PR #135](https://github.com/WB-DevWorld/cetech-pwa-pos/pull/135) holds the UI-only review candidate; [UI evidence](tests/frontend/evidence/ui-refinement-2026-10-03/README.md) records tests, screenshots, contributor provenance and the pinned receipt compatibility checkout. The designated independent human reviewer is @Ben-001-sys; approval is pending and AI quality review does not supply that approval. No integration/main merge, staging alias change, database write or production promotion occurred. Final upstream cutoff: 2026-10-03T02:12:22.605Z, main `c49045dd02c46574af5d341cc65c177116fa7306`, declared integration `1021cd113c783e25030fe9c0bda1be9ddcf5888c`. Final remote head and exact-head CI result belong in the PR handoff. No autonomous third freshness pass.

## RECEIPT-REF-01 — reference receipt layout and bounded settings — REVIEW HANDOFF

Owner instructions on 2026-10-03: implement the receipt reference and accepted configuration recommendation; update the existing tester URL after qualification. This authorizes a bounded WS1 receipt/settings presentation reassignment to the senior implementing editor and the necessary WS3 schema, settings, immutable snapshot and print composition changes. It does not transfer general WS1 ownership. Current explicit owner instructions govern this new assignment over historical task prohibitions below.

```text
human / implementing editor: @wbdevworld
workstream: WS3 + bounded WS1 receipt/settings surfaces
task: RECEIPT-REF-01
branch: ws3/receipt-layout-2026-10-03

staging tester URL: https://cetech-pos-staging-git-integration-9578df-wbdevworlds-projects.vercel.app/
allowed:
  receipt settings schema/types, core settings and server persistence
  additive receipt presentation migration and focused database tests
  sale finalization receipt snapshot only
  ReceiptPaper, receipt view mapping, sell receipt CSS
  receipt Management editor and preview/test print
  device printer paper preference and Settings binding
  existing browser print adapter only
  focused receipt tests, staff documentation, ADR/evidence and this ledger
forbidden:
  commerce pricing/payment/refund/stock/recovery changes
  protected main or existing frozen PR #133 source edits
  production promotion, VitePOS cutover, #102 incident disposition
  destructive data cleanup or rewritten historical receipts
review:
  fresh exact-head CI and different competent human source review
  staging rollout is authorized; production remains unauthorized
```

Receipt presentation settings remain location-scoped; paper width is a separate local printer preference. Snapshot content freezes presentation at completion and reads without live settings on reprint. Parallel contributors use isolated worktrees with non-overlapping scopes; the senior controls canonical schema generation and integration.

Receipt source implementation and local combined verification are complete. Final remote candidate/CI/freshness and rollout state are recorded in PR #134. Independent reviewer: @Ben-001-sys (approval pending). The owner subsequently authorized a one-time staging exception, and candidate `37bcc76ac33e3c9eb8bded2c49cb2f319223ae89` plus the additive receipt migration were deployed to the existing tester alias. Normal independent review remains pending; no merge or production promotion occurred. All contributor worktree leases for that task are released after import.

## RECEIPT-TOP-01 — preserve selected paper and start printing at the top

Current owner instruction, 2026-10-03: “my same size but it should be at the top.” This is a bounded correction to the receipt release, retaining the existing tester URL and paper/text size. The previous exact receipt source `37bcc76ac33e3c9eb8bded2c49cb2f319223ae89` is already on staging under the recorded owner exception; PR #134 remains open for Ben. No independent approval is implied by deployment.

  fixed-sheet Chromium PDFs cover CSS-preferred and driver-preferred modes
  long receipts paginate, no clipping/blank leading page, print lifecycle preserved
  sample printing has no commerce effects; exact source CI green

```

The receipt_render contributor produced local source `e595619e4bd6cf1609ad8e768397d0e1bbbbf5bd` from the pinned equivalent receipt baseline. Its four allowed files were imported without other contributor changes. The contributor lease is released; the root is now the sole integration editor. Local source review found no new runtime blocker. Focused verification passed: 16 unit tests, 9 Chromium tests, focused lint and TypeScript. A negative control using the old helper failed the actual PDF heading-position assertion (~197 pt down), demonstrating that the new tests detect the reported defect rather than only checking DOM position or CSS spelling. Exact remote combined SHA, CI, final freshness and rollout evidence belong in the PR handoff. Physical printer/Safari output remains unverified.


## UI-REL-20261003 — combined UI and receipt tester deployment — ACTIVE

Current owner instructions, 2026-10-03 03:04 UTC: “IMPLEMENT THE UI AND RETAIN THE RECEIPT CHANGES”, “DEPLOY THEM TO SAME LINK”, “AS TESTERS”. This explicitly authorizes combined staging qualification and deployment under the previously requested one-time owner release exception. The implementing/integration editor remains @wbdevworld / WS3 with the bounded WS1 UI reassignment. AI review supplies evidence; no independent human approval is asserted.

- Integration branch: `ws3/ui-receipts-testers-2026-10-03`; root is the sole integration editor, using an isolated checkout.
- UI source: PR #135 / `b8fb4610092dc544e5bba76f920048d170088600`, tree `2ee0f9b23b3b797cb7a40c29c3be5d180c3d5e58`.
- Receipt and top-print source: `0ce2db1be990a75fec500c410e980384fd05ec74`, tree `75df239ff4bc4b4ece0421ad268b01da42b4eedd`; local equivalent `d2816447203f6ef76b6eb683643811da12afe92f`.
- Provisional combined UI/receipt verification source before top-print import: `1cf24631a7eec96703c5f370dfc6b0917e57cfb0`.
- Allowed: import these declared tested sources; compose shared presentation and staff-doc hunks; qualification tests and evidence; this ledger; publish a combined review candidate; create a qualified staging Preview and move only the existing tester alias.
- Tester URL: https://cetech-pos-staging-git-integration-9578df-wbdevworlds-projects.vercel.app/
- Required qualification: preserved UI/receipt source union, source review, foundation/lint/typecheck/unit/build/browser checks, exact-head Linux/Windows CI, immutable Preview identity/smoke, same-hostname acceptance after alias assignment.
- Receipt migration `20261003012953` is already applied to CETECH POS staging; this assignment does not reapply it. Read-only catalog inspection verified the JSONB column and single optional-argument RPC with service-role-only execution.
- Rollback must retain additive receipt contract/parser support. Use the qualified receipt/top-print Preview as fallback, not pre-receipt pricing-only source `2c7eb2d` after new snapshots exist.
- Forbidden: permanent review/workflow/protection changes, fabricated approval, main/integration merge, production promotion, electronic payment/refund/restock, VitePOS cutover, historical receipt rewrite, cache/IndexedDB/draft/journal clearing, secret disclosure, unrelated source changes.
- Expiry: this exact combined tester release handoff; Ben's independent source review remains pending and the exception does not authorize future releases.
- Staff documentation impact: YES. Preserve current UI guide/workbook changes and the latest receipt paper/top-position instructions in their maintained copies.

Final combined local/remote SHA, exact-head CI results, immutable Preview and alias evidence belong in the combined PR handoff and its release evidence index. The earlier UI task's two-pass cutoff remains historical; this is a new owner-authorized deployment assignment, not an autonomous third freshness pass.


## MANAGE-REMEDIATION-01 — current tester management defects — IMPLEMENT / REVIEW HANDOFF

Owner report on 2026-10-03 requests receipt settings across locations with local differences, usable staff/access and removal controls, actionable manager return oversight, truthful system status and matching skeletons, and continuation of the unresolved sale investigation. Existing urgent direction is to fix discovered tester defects. This is a new bounded assignment, not reuse of the consumed SALE-RECOVERY-01 release exception.

- Acting human/editor: @wbdevworld / WS3 senior. Original WS1 surface owner remains Ben; this owner-requested remediation delegates only the named management/feedback surfaces for this assignment. Reviewer: @Ben-001-sys; AI review is evidence only.
- Integration branch/worktree: ws3/management-remediation-2026-10-03 / management-remediation. Baseline deployed source51c0664d3ca96c5742ff6a2324a2fdf412dddd3b; qualified local equivalent cd36379e1930ef7acee8c487d2a204ef0bca30ae, treef423e2ea1410a54b853b0b849a8bf2213aa4c51d. Declared integration1021cd113c783e25030fe9c0bda1be9ddcf5888c; mainc49045dd02c46574af5d341cc65c177116fa7306 (fresh start observation recorded separately).
- Allowed: src/core/receipt/settings*, src/server/receipt/settings-store*, src/server/admin/** for these management defects, bounded src/server/auth/assignment and src/core/checkout topology checks, src/app/management* and matching admin API routes, src/features/admin/*Panel*, ManagementLoading*, admin.css; safe health/attention feedback, scoped manager existing-order recovery, a require-original-repair guard in src/server/sales/prepare-sale.ts and its Attention mount in workspace-runtime.tsx; focused tests/e2e; docs/ledger and additive operational migrations.
- Root alone owns generated/wire contracts, migration allocation/import, shared management-runtime/client/ManagementScreen and admin.css, staff documentation and integration. Contributors use isolated worktrees with non-overlapping leases, recorded below; shared file changes return as exact hunks for root.
- Receipt contributor: receipt settings core/server/admin persistence + ReceiptSettingsPanel/preview and focused tests. Add org defaults and explicit sparse location overrides; preserve existing rows until explicit reset. Root imports audited SQL proposal and shared-composition changes. No printer changes.
- Staff contributor: staff-access directory/panel, identity status handling and focused tests. Correct missing-identity display, bounded pagination and history-preserving deactivation; propose serialized owner safeguard separately. No account deletion or live role changes.
- Returns contributor: returns-attention read models/handlers + panel and focused tests, exact scoped read-only detail routes, expired-preview/action explanations. No new refund/restock engine; no automatic effects or live approvals.
- Skeleton contributor: ManagementLoading and page call sites that do not overlap other contributors; returns/staff/receipt call-site changes go to root. Matching layout variants and focused loading tests only; CSS hunks go to root.
- Topology contributor: topology panel/admin handlers and new-effect active-parent checks, focused tests, atomic SQL proposal only. Preserve historical access; block lifecycle transitions around unresolved shifts. Root imports additive SQL after serialized review.
- Sale recovery contributor: scoped manager capability/read and explicit existing-order repair using a server reconstruction proven equal to the durable original request hash. Reuse the original transaction/key, current operational manager location authority and existing order-repair safeguards; block any incomplete proof. No payment or browser journal impersonation. The live business action remains forbidden to the agent.
- Canonical truth: Woo commerce; Supabase operations/config/assignments; Auth provider identity mapping; IndexedDB saved carts/journal. No email-based identity merge. Organization administration does not grant operational money authority.
- Contracts affected: internal management payloads only initially; frozen commerce/receipt v1 remains compatible. Receipt shared-default refinement records the owner's new direction separately from ADR-018's earlier bounded exclusion.
- Forbidden: protected main/integration merge, production, permanent release bypass/rule changes, account/location hard deletion, live role/grant/deactivation, actual sale repair/payment/refund/restock, Woo/WS2 edits, historical receipt rewrites, storage/journal/cache clearing, secret disclosure, dependencies/lockfile/CI redesign.
- Acceptance: deterministic shared/override receipt settings, immutable reprints; accurate linked identity/access, safe history-preserving lifecycle; location-authorized return actions and expiry feedback; matching responsive accessible loaders; meaningful unit/browser/SQL tests, exact-head CI, independent review. Missing live evidence stays UNVERIFIED.
- Staff documentation impact: YES. Update canonical guide/workbook and maintained reading copies with the actual final behavior.
- Expiry: exact source review/handoff for this task. A new explicit release decision is required before changing the tester alias or applying its migration; the earlier one-time bypass was consumed. No automatic third freshness pass; this new assignment has its own start and exactly two final observations.

The combined source and local qualification are complete; [management remediation evidence](docs/testing/management-remediation-2026-10-03/README.md) records contributor imports, 1,718 unit and 72 browser checks, migration/static-review limits and live diagnostic boundaries. Root retains publication, exact-head CI and two-pass handoff only. Final remote source, Linux/Windows CI, freshness cutoff and any new release decision belong in the draft PR. No live repair, settings/access/lifecycle mutation, migration application or tester alias change has occurred in this assignment.


## PERF-SAFETY-20261005 — Phase 2 bounded performance/correctness batch — ACTIVE

Owner instruction, 2026-10-05: “alright... on to the next phase”, after the Phase-1 technical verdict. This authorizes the report's narrow implementation sequence; it does not authorize production, migrations, release bypass, or tester alias changes.

- Acting editor/integration lead: @wbdevworld / WS3 senior. Fresh bounded WS1 reassignment: scanner intent preservation only, from original WS1 owner Ben to this owner-requested remediation. Independent human reviewer: @Ben-001-sys; AI reviews are supporting evidence only.
- Branch/worktree: `ws3/performance-safety-2026-10-05` / `implementation/pos-performance`. Baseline exact deployed source `816e0bb6963aff760609a3c7e4817e603c4ffdf0`; protected main `c49045dd02c46574af5d341cc65c177116fa7306`; integration `1021cd113c783e25030fe9c0bda1be9ddcf5888c`. Start refs fetched/pruned and open PRs/issues reconciled. Tester Preview `dpl_nxWGrSLqaLBGNNN683QjdixNBjF6` remains unchanged.
- First task: SCAN-INTENT-01. Frozen manual scope: `docs/testing/performance-2026-10-05/scope-scan-intent-01.json`, SHA256 aaba74f661d4cbb55dd5fbc8805951f6eec38e5ca4dd66a883f28010bb0f1985. #104 general enforcement remains a separate task; this batch validates actual diff against a separately frozen copy.
- Scanner contributor `frontend_audit`: isolated worktree; SellScreen, CartPanel, scanIntentQueue helper and its unit test only. Root imports exact tested changes.
- Browser contributor `research_qualification`: isolated worktree; `apps/pos-web/e2e/sell-scanner-intents.spec.ts` only. Uses safe local fixtures, no staging orders.
- Root owns ledger, manifests, staff guide/workbook and maintained mirrors, evidence, import, final tests and publication. No concurrent mutable checkout.
- Contracts/schema/dependencies: unchanged. Scanner queue is transient UI intent, never payment/order/stock evidence.
- Acceptance: every accepted independent/repeated same-cart scan remains ordered; collision/variation modals pause; rejected lookup is truthful/retryable; reset/unmount cannot replay into a new cart; pending scans synchronously block Pay; authoritative quote/prepare/receipt/journal invariants remain intact.
- Staff documentation impact: YES, rapid scans and pending-scan Pay feedback. Canonical guide/workbook and maintained copies move together.
- Forbidden: core/server/local changes in this first scope, pricing/stock/payment/refund/receipt authority changes, migrations/indexes/lockfiles/CI/release changes, Woo/Delivery edits, protected refs/peer branches, main merge, runtime business writes, deployment/alias changes, production, VitePOS cutover, destructive storage cleanup or fabricated review/runtime evidence.
- Next candidate: selected-register same-hydration duplicate read elimination, under a separate frozen manifest before its edits. Quote scheduling remains diagnostic-only until measured latency tradeoff is justified.
- Expiry: this tested review-candidate handoff; no automatic extension to broad optimizations. Final publication requires exactly two bounded freshness observations after checkpoint; stop after Pass 2.

### REGISTER-READ-01 — separate bounded WS3 optimization

Frozen scope: `docs/testing/performance-2026-10-05/scope-register-read-01.json`, SHA256 73a6183f925a469a8f119555134c84cd37623174ed7fe502694f2511de3e2702. Same freshly reconciled base816e0bb. Contributor `transaction_woo_audit`, isolated worktree, edits only staff-runtime.ts and its test. Root owns evidence/import/publication. Reuse only a successful matching register response from this same hydration; failed/missing/mismatched results retain fallback reads; explicit selection, fresh context/assignment and activeShift authority remain unchanged. Staff documentation impact: NO, internal redundant success-path read only. No database/server/policy/cache/deployment change. Lease expires after exact tested import/handoff.

### REGISTER-REFRESH-GUARD-01 — measured connected reliability defect

Strengthening the duplicate-read regression exposed a delayed activeShift hydration overwriting a newer applied shift; the historical test had not entered the claimed asynchronous barrier. This bounded WS3 correctness fix is recorded separately before edits, rather than silently expanding REGISTER-READ-01. Frozen scope `docs/testing/performance-2026-10-05/scope-register-refresh-guard-01.json`, SHA256 ebb3a9dcf4676f58ef26e98d9d2be395ad916303d6ba147e451ee057752e27d8. Same controller/test contributor and base; recheck existing captured refresh authority after awaited hydration, before state/preference/offline publication. No global applyShift epoch redesign, server/auth-policy change, migration or release. Staff documentation impact NO: existing stale-refresh guarantee is enforced. Acceptance requires original-source negative control, current auth fail-closed behavior and newer-shift preservation.

### Scanner boundary test maintenance — explicit scope extension before edit

The full native browser suite passes77/77. Full unit has only an obsolete literal scanner-hook assertion (1733/1734 pass). Frozen `scope-scan-test-maintenance.json`, SHA256 c4429877856c675cdcfb9c9c3dfdce25744f5443ab9341a04ffe9762a6075678, adds only `tests/frontend/sell-boundaries.test.ts` to the connected test scope. Root adapts the static assertion to the expanded modal/catalog/transition/checkout/variation gate; no production behavior change or test deletion. This is regression maintenance for SCAN-INTENT-01, not another optimization or #104 implementation.

### Phase 2 tested integration checkpoint / contributor leases released

Imported register `f194f841` as `b80bd9e`, browser `e0be691f` as `23cda3b`, scanner `9fee56cd` as `e9c92379`. Exact non-overlapping contribution files and production parity independently reviewed; all three contributor editor leases are released. Root is sole remaining integration/docs/publication editor. Full native browser77/77, unit1734/1734 (`TZ=UTC`), typecheck/build and lint pass (five warnings only in untouched paths). Connected literal scanner-boundary assertion was updated under its pre-recorded test scope. Test-generated tracked fixture/HTML changes are restored, not included. Final remote tree/head, exact-head CI and exactly two final freshness observations belong in the PR/final report. No source is merged or live accepted; independent human review remains pending. Tester alias, migrations and production unchanged.

### CI receipt alert locator — bounded test-only gate repair

## PERF-QUOTE-20261005 — fresh bounded continuation

Owner instruction, 5 October 2026 at 19:19 UTC: continue the next steps, multiple scoped steps, subagents and thorough qualification.

The prior PERF-SAFETY-20261005 task is complete as a review candidate: remote `3c2a5a6a`, tree `a8eee058`, draft/unmerged PR #139, final Linux/Windows CI `37359202290` PASS, and FRESH_2 cutoff `18:59:53.944887 UTC`. All previous implementation leases expired. Its earlier ACTIVE header/checkpoint does not reopen source work. No third observation of that old task is permitted.

### New source and editor boundaries

- Base: exact PR #139 head `3c2a5a6af4ab202988e46bb3af6d3ae365147be8`, a provisional predecessor, not merged or live acceptance.
- Root branch/worktree: `ws3/performance-quote-2026-10-05` / `implementation/pos-quote-performance`. Fresh start fetches completed; main `c49045dd`, integration `1021cd`, tester `816e0bb`, Delivery master `637c02f` unchanged.
- Acting senior/integration editor: @wbdevworld / WS3. Existing #132 explicitly allows WS3 quote orchestration/transport timing and a bounded consumer implementation lease. This fresh senior delegation names only useCartQuote.ts, quoteDispatchWindow.ts and their named tests. It does not reuse the expired scanner lease or grant unrelated WS1/WS2 ownership.
- Frontend contributor `frontend_audit`: isolated `local/quote-consumer-2026-10-05` / `implementation/quote-consumer`; QUOTE-CONTEXT-01 first. QUOTE-DISPATCH-01 is now HELD as described below.
- Server contributor `transaction_woo_audit`: isolated `local/quote-timing-2026-10-05` / `implementation/quote-timing`; exact four paths in QUOTE-TIMING-01 only.
- Root alone owns CURRENT-WORK, all scope files, staff documentation, imports, integration tests and publication. Contributors may not edit those or the shared checkout.
- Independent human reviewer: @Ben-001-sys. AI review is supporting evidence only; no author self-approval or consumed release exception is reused.

### Frozen manual scopes and narrower implementation queue

The following files were recorded before product edits and frozen separately under audit/phase3/scopes; actual diff must be a subset of their union. This is not implementation of general #104 enforcement.

1. QUOTE-CONTEXT-01, SHA256 `e724ac1cec77cde8aac63f467069ea9f5f8eac27dfadd57ac2de890d27a7b060`: full commercial request applicability before rendering confirmed price/Pay, including same-cart/revision location/customer changes. Actual mounted baseline exposes stale confirmed eligibility; the full-key prototype fails closed.
2. QUOTE-DISPATCH-01, SHA256 `7040649a015dd33a9215d8bf2cc4d07cd115e8903d5f7430c7610285cf4a42ac`: bounded 100ms revision dispatch prototype. HELD after benchmark: burst calls20→6–7 and continuous80→10, but worst-phase healthy latest readiness adds about94ms. Live capacity benefit is unproven. No dispatch source implementation/import is currently authorized; preserve prototype evidence for a separate retain/reject decision.
3. QUOTE-TIMING-01, SHA256 `98a063b3ed3065d519ab1b249551b4419719ce354f7e19fa2091bda39dd7e6a9`: safe Server-Timing header from existing BFF stage durations. Exact route/formatter/tests only; no extra upstream requests.

Current implementation queue: context guard; safe phase header; connected qualification and handoff. No scheduling delay is introduced while its measured healthy-path tradeoff lacks runtime capacity justification.

### Acceptance and protected invariants

Current location/customer/cart/revision/lines must match the confirmed request before Pay, synchronously. Preserve failed/expired/reconnect revalidation, changed-price review, equivalent-object request stability, late-response/cart-replacement/unmount isolation, current transport deadlines and fresh server authorization. No successful quote cache or authorization cache. Local cart feedback remains immediate.

Server-Timing includes fixed names and finite nonnegative durations only, on success and typed/error responses. BFF elapsed excludes external network and serialization. Keep response body/status/no-store/correlation, request counts and auth semantics. No raw identifiers, credential payload, TAO or CORS expansion.

Staff documentation impact: YES for the context candidate and acceptance expectations; root updates guide/workbook plus both maintained mirrors. Header diagnostics alone have no operator-flow impact. Required gates: focused actual-source tests, connected scanner/cart/quote/checkout/auth/session regressions, native browser qualification, pinned build/typecheck/lint/foundation/tooling and exact-head Linux/Windows CI. Missing live evidence remains UNVERIFIED.

No Woo/Delivery/plugin, migrations/indexes/grants/RLS/schema, dependencies/CI/service-worker/storage, contracts, commerce/payment/stock/order/refund/receipt/journal authority changes; no runtime business writes, production, main merge, shared alias promotion or bypass. A diagnostic quote POST persists a snapshot; this run has not issued one. DB-SEC-01 and the WS2 global-order-count race remain separate gates.

Expiry: tested new-batch review handoff. This task has a fresh start and exactly two final successful observations; stop source work after Pass2. #115/#132 remain open until correlated runtime qualification is complete.

### Tested integration checkpoint / contributor leases released

Imported QUOTE-CONTEXT-01 `56572b99` as `a3a24b26` and QUOTE-TIMING-01 `3f8f7667` as `87d62b11`; exactly2+4 approved source/test files. Both contributor implementation leases are released; root alone completes documentation, publication and handoff. QUOTE-DISPATCH-01 remains HELD with no implementation files. Native exact-hook comparison passes14/14 scenarios and28/28 candidate checks; baseline fails4 context scenarios. Full production-build browser suite77/77, unit1763/1763 across210 files, build/typecheck/foundation/tooling76 PASS. Lint has zero errors and five existing warnings in untouched files. Known39 unit-generated outputs and12 browser-generated PNGs are preserved externally and restored, not committed. No retries/skips, migration, grants/indexes, Woo/Delivery, dependencies, business writes or production effects.

Independent AI review supports qualification only; different-human review remains required. Exact remote tree/head, Linux/Windows CI, preview identity and exactly two final freshness observations are recorded externally and in the draft PR. The shared tester alias and installed bridge source are not qualified by this local checkpoint. No live transaction speed improvement is claimed. New task leases expire on its tested review-candidate handoff; any further source change requires a new bounded task/scope.
