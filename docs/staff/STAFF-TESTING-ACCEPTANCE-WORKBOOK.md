# CETECH POS — Staff Testing & Acceptance Workbook

**Purpose:** Help staff test the POS systematically, not randomly.  
**Audience:** Cashiers, managers, owners/admins, and authorized support testers.  
**Rule:** Test the exact build recorded in the Test Brief. Do not mix results from different builds.

---

## 1. How to record every test

Make your own copy of this workbook and write your results in it.

For every test you perform, add this result block underneath that test:

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST  
**What actually happened:**  
**Anything confusing:**  
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path  
**Other notes:**  

At the top of your completed workbook, also record:

- Tester name:
- Date/time:
- Device:
- Browser / installed PWA:
- Test role:
- Test version/build shown in the Test Brief:

### Screenshots and photos

If the screen shows something important, unusual, confusing, or wrong, capture it where relevant.

You may either:

- embed the image directly in this Markdown file; or
- save it separately and write the exact filename/path in the result block.

Recommended screenshot folder:

`screenshots/`

Recommended filename format:

`<TEST-ID>-<short-description>-<number>.png`

Examples:

- `screenshots/T40-cash-sale-01.png`
- `screenshots/T61-blank-print-preview-01.png`
- `screenshots/T102-offline-reopen-01.png`

If you embed an image in Markdown, use the normal Markdown image format and point it to the exact screenshot file you submit.

Keep the screenshot filename/path unchanged after you reference it.

### What to submit

Save your completed workbook using:

`POS-Test-Results-YourName-2026-09-24.md`

Save screenshots in a folder such as:

`POS-Test-Screenshots-YourName-2026-09-24/`

Then submit:

1. the completed Testing Workbook; and
2. the entire screenshot/photo folder containing every file referenced in the workbook.

Example:

- Workbook: `POS-Test-Results-Ama-2026-09-24.md`
- Screenshot: `POS-Test-Screenshots-Ama-2026-09-24/T61-blank-print-preview-01.png`

If you embed screenshots directly in the Markdown file, keep the referenced image files with the document so the images still open.

### A PASS means

The steps completed and the result matched the expected behavior.

### A FAIL means

The result did not match the expected behavior.

### PARTLY WORKED means

Some of the expected result worked, but something important was wrong.

### COULD NOT TEST means

The test was blocked by environment, access, configuration, hardware, or another known issue.

Do not mark a blocked test as PASS.

# Q. FREE-FORM STAFF FEEDBACK

After structured testing, ask every tester:

1. What was confusing?
2. What took too many clicks?
3. What wording did you not understand?
4. What did you expect to happen that did not happen?
5. What happened that you did not expect?
6. Which part felt slow?
7. Did you ever feel unsure whether a sale/payment/refund had already happened?
8. Was anything technical shown that a normal cashier should not see?
9. Was anything important hidden from you?
10. Would you feel safe using this with a real customer? Why or why not?

Do not replace the structured tests with free-form feedback. Use both.
