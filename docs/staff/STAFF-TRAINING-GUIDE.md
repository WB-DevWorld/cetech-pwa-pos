# CETECH POS — Staff Training & User Guide

**Updated for this testing round:** 3 October 2026 — management candidate guidance added.

**UI refinement candidate — 3 October 2026:** Additional guidance marked **Candidate UI** describes `ws1/ui-refinement-2026-10-03`. Use it only when the coordinator confirms that candidate in the Test Brief. This note does not mean the existing POS link has been updated.

**Management remediation candidate — 3 October 2026:** Guidance marked **Candidate Management** describes the current management correction candidate. Use it only after the coordinator confirms its exact build in the Test Brief. Source changes and these instructions do not establish that the shared POS link has changed or that a reported live problem is resolved.

**Scanner safety candidate — 5 October 2026:** Guidance marked **Candidate Scanner** applies only after the coordinator confirms this candidate's exact build in the Test Brief. The shared POS link has not been changed by this source patch.

**Read and understand the [current Test Brief](TEST-BRIEF-2026-10-02.md) first.**

**[Open the POS for this round](https://cetech-pos-staging-git-integration-9578df-wbdevworlds-projects.vercel.app)**

Use this same address when opening or installing the POS. If your installed POS already uses it and works, keep using it and preserve your saved work.

**Audience:** Cashiers, managers, owners/admins, and authorized support staff  
**Language:** Plain operational English  
**Purpose:** Teach staff how to use the POS safely during normal work  
**Important:** This guide describes intended behavior for the build being tested. The exact test build must be recorded in the Test Brief.

## 1. What CETECH POS is for

CETECH POS is the system staff use at the counter to:

1. sign in;
2. open or continue a register shift;
3. find or scan products;
4. choose a customer when needed;
5. confirm the price;
6. take payment;
7. complete the sale;
8. print or reprint a receipt;
9. find previous orders;
10. process returns;
11. close the shift when authorized.

The basic selling idea is:

**Scan → Sell → Pay → Print**

The system may do complicated work in the background, but ordinary staff should see simple retail language.

---

## 2. Roles — what different people can do

### Cashier

A cashier normally works with:

- Sell
- Orders
- Customers
- Returns
- Register
- Attention
- Settings
- System status when needed

A cashier should **not** need raw technical details, database IDs, API names, build numbers, provider names, or developer terminology to serve a customer.

### Manager

A manager can do cashier work and may also have a **Management** area for locations they manage.

Depending on the rules configured for the location, a manager may be able to:

- review shifts and cash;
- close shifts;
- review cash differences;
- approve a return when manager approval is required;
- check an unresolved refund;
- update register assignments for staff already assigned to a managed location;
- view operational rules;
- view receipt settings;
- view System status and the activity log.

### Owner / Admin

Owner/Admin access is organization-level control.

An Admin may also sell, but needs a separate Cashier or Manager assignment at the location and an assigned register. Admin alone does not grant every shift or return-approval permission.

Depending on the exact authorization, they can manage:

- staff accounts;
- POS access;
- organization roles;
- cashier/manager assignments;
- locations;
- registers;
- devices;
- operational rules;
- receipt settings;
- management diagnostics;
- activity/audit history.

### Support

Support access is for diagnostics and audit where authorized. Support access does not automatically give cashier, manager, refund, cash, or organization-control authority.

# PART A — CASHIER TRAINING

## 3. Signing in

1. Open CETECH POS from the current Test Brief link above.
2. Enter your **staff email**.
3. Enter your **password**.
4. Select **Sign in**.

**Candidate UI:** Select **Show** to check the password you typed, then **Hide** to conceal it again. This changes its display only; it does not clear or change the password.

If your temporary password must be changed, the POS will show **Choose a new password** before opening the rest of the POS.

If you see:

- **Session expired** — sign in again. Your safe local cart should remain available.
- **Access denied** — open the POS link in the current Test Brief first. If it still fails, ask a manager to check your access. Record the website address, the message, and any Reference line. This message can also appear when a different POS address is not accepted; it does not always mean your password is wrong.
- **Register locked** — sign in to continue the existing shift.
- **Sign-in unavailable** — try again. A **Reference** line under that notice is a support id. Read it to a manager. It is not a password.

A wrong email or password stays **Incorrect email or password.** That message does not add a Reference line.

Disabled POS access stays **Your POS access is disabled. Contact a manager.** That message does not add a Reference line.

Do not use another staff member's login.

---

## 4. Main navigation

The normal POS navigation contains the main work areas:

- **Sell** — create and complete a sale.
- **Orders** — find completed/recent sales, reprint receipts, and start returns.
- **Customers** — find a customer to use for a sale.
- **Returns** — review and complete return workflows.
- **Register** — open, view, and close a shift when permitted.
- **Attention** — work that needs review or recovery.
- **Settings** — device/register information, appearance, and System status.

Management functions are separate and should only appear to people who are authorized.

**Candidate UI:** On a phone, work areas appear along the bottom; swipe that navigation sideways when needed. The working register stays near the top. When work needs review, the mobile **Needs attention** shortcut keeps its count visible. Routine confirmations appear below the header rather than covering the selling controls.

**Candidate UI:** Grey placeholder rows/cards mean Orders, Customers, or a shift report is loading. Wait for actual details before using them. Price-check timing, failures, and retry instructions still follow **10. Price status**; placeholder feedback is not proof of faster pricing.

---

## 5. Opening the register / starting a shift

Before taking payment, the POS needs an open shift.

1. Open **Register**.
2. Choose the correct **Register** if more than one is available.
3. Choose the correct **POS device** when asked.
4. Enter the **opening cash** actually placed in the drawer.
5. Select **Open register**.

Important:

- Opening a register requires a connection.
- Only active devices assigned to the correct location can be used.
- Do not choose a different register just to bypass an error.
- If the system says the register/device is unavailable, ask a manager.

Once open, Register shows the working register and shift status.

Only one open or closing shift is allowed on a register at a time. People who need independent shifts need separate registers, even when they have separate accounts. Each register's location must have an active POS device.

---

## 6. Finding products

On **Sell**, you can normally find a product by:

- scanning its barcode;
- typing its name;
- typing its SKU or another supported identifier.

### Barcode scanner

For a keyboard-style barcode scanner:

1. click/focus the normal selling screen if needed;
2. scan the product;
3. wait for the product to appear in the cart or for the POS to ask you to choose a variation.

**Candidate Scanner:** Quick successive scans of ordinary products should all appear in scan order. Scanning the same barcode twice should add two units. If the POS asks you to choose a product or variation, finish or cancel that choice before scanning more. Scans already received wait for that choice. Check the cart and quantities before paying.

Pay stays unavailable while a received scan is still being added or needs a choice. If **Barcode lookup is unavailable** appears, use **Retry barcode lookup**, or **Cancel pending scan** only when you intend to leave that scan out. Check the cart afterward; cancelling a scan does not cancel a payment or completed sale. If variations cannot load, use **Retry variations** and check the chosen item before paying.

Do not manually shorten or rename product data because a product name is long. Compact POS screens may visually show only part of a long name, but the underlying product name remains complete.

**Candidate UI:** Use **Grid** or **List** above the product results. **Compact** switches between a tighter product display and the comfortable display. These are preferences for this browser/device; they do not change products, prices, or receipts. **List** wraps full product names; keyboard focus expands a product name in **Grid**. Full names wrap in the cart.

---

## 7. Product variations

If a product has choices such as size, colour, specification, or another variation:

1. choose the correct variation;
2. confirm the variation shown in the cart;
3. verify the price before taking payment.

If you are not sure which variation the customer wants, do not guess.

---

## 8. Working with the cart

In the cart you can normally:

- add products;
- change quantity;
- remove products;
- see Subtotal, Discount, Tax, and Total;
- clear/discard a sale when safe.

The cart should show the current working sale only.

A completed cart should no longer remain as an ordinary active cart. Do not clear browser/site storage to fix a cart-count problem; report it.

---

## 9. Choosing a customer

The safe default is **Walk-in**.

Use **Customers** or the customer picker on Sell when you need to attach a known customer.

Customers may be:

- Walk-in;
- Retail;
- Wholesale.

For a wholesale customer, the POS must obtain the proper authoritative price. Staff should not manually recreate wholesale pricing rules.

After selecting a customer, verify the customer shown before payment.

---

## 10. Price status

Before payment, the POS may show that the price is being checked.

The cashier-friendly successful state is:

**Price ready**

If price information needs to be checked again, follow the message shown by the POS.

If the POS shows **Check price again**, select it once. It checks the same cart; it does not make a payment or create another sale. Keep the products and quantities as they are while the check finishes. Pay stays unavailable until the price is ready.

If the check fails again or stays on **Updating price…**, record how long you waited and take a screenshot. Continue a different test while the problem is investigated. Do not clear saved POS work or make up a replacement price.

Do not manually calculate a replacement total when the POS says the price is unavailable.

---

## 11. Starting payment

Select **Pay** only when:

- the correct products are in the cart;
- the correct quantities are shown;
- the correct customer is selected;
- the price is ready;
- the correct register/shift is open.

The available payment methods depend on what is configured for that test/location.

Possible methods can include:

- Cash
- Mobile Money
- Card
- External terminal

A payment method should not appear as usable merely because a provider account exists. It must be enabled and verified for that environment.

---

## 12. Cash payment

For cash:

1. choose **Cash**;
2. enter the amount received if the POS asks;
3. verify the amount;
4. confirm the cash payment once.

Do not press the confirmation button repeatedly because the screen is slow.

If the POS becomes uncertain after payment, keep the current sale and follow the on-screen recovery message.

If Pay does not reach payment, keep the same cart. A sale that was not sent can be tried again on that same cart. A sale that was not created can be retried or cleared only after that attempt is finished. If the POS cannot prove whether the sale was created, it keeps that same attempt for a manager. It shows **This needs manual review. Contact a manager or support.** If the register says an existing order cannot yet be opened for payment, leave that order as it is and ask a manager. Do not start another sale for that cart. If the screen says payment was already submitted, do not charge again. If the sale is complete but the official receipt is not on this register, contact a manager and do not take payment again. Do not start a second sale for that attempt, and do not clear the browser's saved data to repair it.

---

## 13. Electronic payment

Only test/use an electronic method that the test coordinator has explicitly enabled.

If the POS says:

**Payment is still being checked. Do not charge again.**

do exactly that.

Do not:

- start a second payment;
- use a different payment reference for the same sale;
- create another sale to “try again”.

Use **Attention** or ask a manager when the payment remains unresolved.

---

## 14. Sale completed

A sale is complete only after the POS confirms completion.

After completion:

- the completed cart is retired from the active selling workspace;
- a new clean selling workspace becomes available;
- the receipt remains printable/reprintable independently;
- the completed sale should appear in Orders.

If the old completed sale remains active or appears as a saved active cart, report it.

---

## 15. Receipts

The customer receipt should use customer-friendly information.

It may include:

- receipt/order reference;
- understandable date and time;
- product/variation description;
- quantity;
- prices/tax/total;
- payment method;
- optional SKU where configured.

Receipt product-name shortening is a **receipt presentation setting**. It must not change the actual product name in the catalog.

Technical details should not be prominent on the customer receipt.

### Printing

Select **Print receipt**.

The browser print preview should show the receipt itself, not a blank page and not the entire POS interface.

Keep the printer's selected paper size. The receipt should start near the top with a small margin, using the same text size. A short receipt may leave unused paper below it; it should not be centered vertically. For thermal printing, match the printer's paper width to the 80 mm or 58 mm choice on this device.

If printing fails:

- do not repeat the sale;
- reprint from the completed sale/order;
- report the print problem separately.

---

## 16. Orders

Open **Orders** to:

- search recent sales;
- search by order, receipt, customer, or transaction reference;
- filter by status;
- open order details;
- reprint a receipt;
- start a return when allowed.

Order dates should be shown in understandable local operational format, not raw computer timestamps.

**Candidate UI:** Full item names wrap in order details. Scroll the item details when needed; **Reprint** and **Return items** stay at the bottom when permitted. With a keyboard, Tab stays within the open dialog; Escape closes it and returns focus to the order you opened.

---

## 17. Customers

Open **Customers** to search by:

- name;
- company;
- phone.

Select **Use for next sale** to carry that customer into the next sale.

If customer search is temporarily unavailable, Walk-in remains the safe fallback unless the sale specifically requires a known customer/wholesale account.

---

## 18. Returns

**Candidate UI:** In Returns, enter an order, customer, or receipt in the search field and select **Search sales** (or press Enter). Select the matching sale. Full item names wrap in the return form. An unresolved return still locks other sales until that same return is checked.

A normal return flow can ask you to:

1. select the sale/order;
2. select the item(s);
3. select quantity;
4. enter a reason;
5. select the item condition;
6. select **Review return**;
7. check the summary;
8. select **Complete return**.

Possible conditions can include:

- Resellable — unopened
- Resellable — opened
- Damaged
- Defective
- Quarantine
- Not physically returned

### What “needs attention” means

A return can involve separate work such as:

- the customer's money;
- the order refund;
- the stock update.

These parts may finish at different times. The POS may therefore show one part as completed while another part still needs checking.

Examples you may see:

- **Cash refund already completed** — do **not** refund the customer again.
- **Order refund needs review** — do **not** create another order refund for the same return.
- **Stock update is not settled yet** — do **not** manually adjust the stock while this return is still being checked.

If part of the return is not safely confirmed, the POS may lock the same return and show that it **needs attention**.

This does **not** mean “start another return”.

Use **Check return status** or **Attention** to review the existing return. If your role cannot resolve it, leave that existing return in place for an authorized manager/support user.

---

## 19. Attention

Attention contains work that needs checking rather than repeating.

Examples:

- payment still being checked;
- sale completion uncertain;
- refund needs confirmation;
- return needs manager review.

The important rule is:

**Resolve the existing work. Do not create a second copy of the same transaction.**

**Original-sale recovery candidate — 3 October 2026:** Use these steps only after the coordinator confirms the recovery build in the Test Brief.

1. Select **Check / Recover**. Wait for the result shown above the attention list.
2. If your session ended, sign in again. Saved carts and unfinished work are kept; the POS does not repeat the operation automatically.
3. If **Repair this sale** is offered, it belongs to the original unfinished sale on this device and register. Select it once to repair that existing order. It does not take payment.
4. After a successful repair, the POS opens **Sell** with the same saved sale and payment choice. Check the order and total before continuing the normal payment steps.
5. If repair cannot prove the original unpaid order and current stock reservation, the sale stays blocked and the result explains why. Record that result for the coordinator. Do not clear browser data, start the same sale again, or retry payment. If the stock reservation expires before you choose payment, new payment stays closed; ask the coordinator to check this same order. Existing payment status can still be checked.

Managers use the same original-device checks. That local recovery action requires the original matching saved attempt; Manager access does not override missing local work, another person's saved work, payment already in progress or expired sign-in.

**Candidate Management:** A separate **Manager sale recovery** panel may appear in Needs attention for existing server-recorded sales within an operational Manager's permitted location scope. Select **Check original sale** first. This reads the original sale without repairing it or taking payment.

**Repair this sale** appears there only after the server confirms the original saved request, the same existing unpaid order, current reservation, original active register/device and open shift, and your location authority. Select it once if offered. It rechecks that evidence and repairs the original sale; it does not create another order, charge a customer or complete payment.

If recovery creates the missing POS sale record, it records the recovering manager as the staff member who prepared it; existing recorded cashier details stay unchanged. The activity log records the manager recovery.

On success, the result says to return to the sale's original register and continue that same sale after checking its current status. No payment was taken. This panel does not automatically turn the manager's current cart into that sale. If original details or safe evidence cannot be proved, use the original device or contact the coordinator/support; do not invent a replacement sale. Owner/Admin membership alone does not grant this operational recovery authority. A source change or recovery button does not prove a reported live sale has already been repaired.

---

## 20. Register and ending a shift

When shift closing is allowed for your role:

1. open **Register**;
2. count the physical drawer cash;
3. enter **what you actually counted**;
4. select **End shift**.

The POS intentionally does not reveal expected cash before you submit the count.

After completion it can show:

- Counted;
- Expected;
- Variance;
- End-of-shift report (Z report).

If the variance requires manager review, do not change the physical count to make it match.

---

## 21. Settings

Cashier Settings shows operational information such as:

- device;
- register;
- scanner capability;
- printer capability;
- theme/appearance;
- link to **System status**.

It should not expose ordinary cashiers to raw build IDs, database/schema details, provider internals, or repair controls.

---

## 22. System status

System status tells staff whether important services are available.

Use it when something appears unavailable.

Cashier-facing System status should explain what is working or unavailable in ordinary language.

Detailed engineering/support information belongs in Management/support views.

---

# PART B — OFFLINE USE

## 23. What should remain usable offline

When a previously verified device/session loses connectivity, the POS should keep the safe local working experience available where possible.

Expected safe offline behavior can include:

- the real POS shell remains visible;
- last verified staff/register presentation remains visible while still valid;
- locally stored product information can remain searchable;
- the current cart/draft remains available;
- the POS clearly says connection is unavailable.

---

## 24. What should stay blocked offline

Offline presentation is **not** fresh commercial authority.

Depending on the current build, the following server-authoritative actions should remain blocked until connection returns:

- fresh authoritative pricing;
- Pay/checkout;
- starting a new electronic payment;
- Returns execution/resolve;
- Attention recovery actions;
- register-changing actions;
- other actions that require server confirmation.

The POS should tell you that a connection is required instead of pretending the operation succeeded.

---

## 25. Reconnecting

When connection returns:

1. allow the POS a moment to re-establish the server session;
2. confirm the current cart is still present;
3. confirm normal pricing/payment/register authority returns;
4. do not create a replacement cart or duplicate transaction merely because the system was offline.

Never clear browser site data, IndexedDB, or caches as a routine cashier fix.

---

# PART C — MANAGER / OWNER / ADMIN TRAINING

## 26. Opening Management

Authorized users can enter a separate **Management** area.

Management is intentionally separate from normal cashier navigation.

Typical sections are:

- Overview
- Staff & access
- Locations
- Registers
- Devices
- Shifts & cash
- Returns & approvals
- System status
- Activity log
- Operational rules
- Receipt settings

What you see depends on your role.

---

## 27. Staff & access

Owner/Admin can manage organization staff access.

### Create account now

1. open **Management → Staff & access**;
2. select **Create account now**;
3. enter Name and Email;
4. create/generate a temporary password;
5. choose any organization role if required;
6. choose location role (Cashier or Manager);
7. choose register assignment;
8. choose whether POS access should be turned on after setup succeeds;
9. select **Create account**.

The staff member must change the temporary password at first sign-in.

### Send invitation

Choose **Send invitation** to email a secure account-setup link.

Invited staff cannot use the POS until their assignments are completed and POS access is enabled.

### POS access

Disabling POS access:

- blocks new POS sign-in;
- signs the person out of active POS sessions.

Do not disable your own access casually.

**Candidate Management:** **Show staff** lets you choose **All staff and references**, **Active staff**, **Inactive staff**, or **Unlinked references**. A linked staff card shows its actual sign-in email, login-account state and POS-access state separately. **Last sign-in** is shown in UTC when available; it is not a promise that the person currently has a working POS session.

**Unlinked staff reference** means no matching login account was found for the saved staff reference. The reference stays visible for history. Do not guess an email, merge people by name, or reset a password on an unlinked reference. If account lookup itself is unavailable, record that error; it does not prove the account is missing.

Owner/Admin can select **Deactivate staff**, review the explanation, then choose **Confirm deactivation** or **Keep active**. Deactivation blocks POS access and revokes active POS sessions. Sales, shifts, assignments and activity history are kept; it does not delete the person's account or erase prior work. **Inactive staff** lets you find the retained record.

**Reactivate staff** restores POS access only when a linked, enabled login account is available and your authority permits it. A disabled or unlinked login needs authorized account review first. You cannot deactivate yourself or an Owner through this ordinary action; transfer/demote Owner responsibility through the authorized role flow first, keeping an active Owner. An Admin cannot reactivate an Owner. Managers retain their permitted register-assignment controls for staff already assigned to a managed location; they do not gain account-deactivation or organization-role powers.

---

## 28. Organization roles

Organization control roles are different from cashier/manager location roles.

Organization roles:

- Owner
- Admin
- Support

Operational location roles:

- Cashier
- Manager

Do not treat “Admin” and “Manager” as the same thing.

At least one active Owner must remain.

---

## 29. Locations

Owner/Admin can add or update locations.

Locations are normally deactivated rather than deleted.

**Candidate Management:** Select **Deactivate location**, review the retained-history explanation, then select **Confirm deactivate**. **Cancel** makes no change. **Reactivate location** makes the retained location available for new work again after confirmation.

Deactivation keeps sales, receipts, staff assignments and history. Close or resolve affected shifts first: an open, closing or needs-attention shift blocks deactivation. An inactive location cannot open a new shift or start a new sale, even if its register and device are still active. Managers can inspect locations they manage; only Owner/Admin can change their availability.

Use meaningful names staff will recognize.

---

## 30. Registers

Owner/Admin can add or update registers.

A register has:

- a location;
- a name;
- a currency;
- a status.

The currency/location relationship is intentionally controlled. Do not casually recreate a register just to change configuration.

A register may be unable to open a shift if its location has no active POS device.

**Candidate Management:** Owner/Admin can select **Disable register** and confirm, or **Reactivate register** for a disabled register. Existing sales and shift history are kept. An open, closing or needs-attention shift blocks disablement or a change into Maintenance. Reactivate the location before reactivating a disabled register. A failed change keeps the current register and its controls visible; read the result before trying again.

---

## 31. Devices

Owner/Admin can add or manage POS devices by location.

A device is assigned to a location and can be Active or Inactive.

Do not use made-up device IDs or browser-generated IDs as operational device authority.

**Candidate Management:** Owner/Admin can select **Deactivate device** or **Reactivate device** and confirm. Device history remains. Deactivation or moving a device to another location is blocked while it belongs to an open, closing or needs-attention shift. An inactive location cannot accept a newly active device; reactivate the location first.

---

## 32. Shifts & cash

Management can review shift/cash information inside authorized scope.

Depending on role and policy, managers can:

- view open/closed shifts;
- view the X report/current shift summary;
- view the durable Z report after close;
- close shifts;
- review cash differences;
- reverse an incorrect cash movement through the controlled correction flow.

A cash correction is an exact reversal of an existing cash entry. Do not edit historical cash entries directly.

---

## 33. Returns & approvals

Management can see returns/refunds that need attention.

Possible actions can include:

- **Approve return** — records manager approval for the same return;
- **Check refund** — checks the existing refund/reconciliation state.

Approval does not itself create a new refund or change stock.

A manager should never create a second refund merely because an existing one is awaiting confirmation.

**Candidate Management:** **Review existing return** opens saved items, return reasons, allocated amounts and separate refund/stock records for that same return. Reviewing does not send a refund, approve a return or change stock. **Refresh return details** reads that same saved return again.

**History** includes completed returns and expired previews that were never executed. **Return preview expired** is not a pending approval and cannot be approved or completed. If a return is still needed, review the original sale again through Returns. **Return preview needs review** means its validity cannot be confirmed. A current **Return preview** in Pending is still a preview, not a pending approval.

Counts represent work items. One return may have separate refund, stock and unfinished-operation entries, so the count is not a count of customers waiting for approval.

**Approve return** is available only to an operational Manager assigned at that return's location, for a current return requiring approval. **Check refund** keeps the corresponding manager/location restriction. Owner/Admin membership alone does not grant either action. An explanation on a read-only entry tells you why no action is offered; keep the same return instead of inventing a replacement.

---

## 34. Operational rules

Operational rules can control things such as:

- whether cashiers can close shifts;
- whether managers can close shifts;
- whether cashiers can close only their own shift;
- whether cash differences require manager review;
- whether returns require manager approval.

Rules can be applied at organization, location, or register level.

More specific rules can override broader defaults.

---

## 35. Receipt settings

Receipt settings remain limited to your authorized scope.

**Candidate Management:** Owner/Admin can choose **Shared defaults — all locations** or **Location overrides** under **Receipt settings scope**. Existing location settings remain unchanged when shared defaults are first saved; they start inheriting only where an authorized operator explicitly changes or clears the relevant local choices.

For the common receipt layout:

1. choose **Shared defaults — all locations**;
2. set the shared business name, logo, footer and display choices;
3. check **Live receipt preview**, then select **Save shared defaults**;
4. select **Apply shared layout to all locations**;
5. review the effect, then select **Confirm: apply shared layout**, or **Cancel**.

This replaces local layout choices with the saved common layout while keeping each location's explicit address, contact phone and tax-registration number, and the actual location name. Historical receipts and device paper width stay unchanged. Unsaved shared changes must be saved before applying the layout to all locations.

Under **Location overrides**, choose a location and check **Customize [field] for this location** only for a difference that belongs there. Unchecked fields inherit shared defaults. Where that field permits it, a checked blank, false or removed-logo choice is an explicit local difference, rather than an instruction to use the shared value. Select **Save location overrides** after reviewing the effective receipt preview.

**Use shared settings for this location** has a broader effect than applying the common layout: after **Confirm: use shared settings**, it clears all receipt overrides for that location, including local address/contact/tax details. Review that explanation before confirming. The actual location name is retained.

Managers can inspect their permitted location settings and sample prints. They cannot edit organization defaults, apply a layout to all locations or save local changes.

Owner/Admin can control:

- **Shorten product names on receipts**;
- **Maximum product-name characters**;
- **Show SKU on receipts**.

The receipt upgrade also adds business name, an uploaded PNG/JPEG logo, address, contact phone, tax registration number, footer message, and options to show customer name, available customer phone and cashier name. Blank optional details are omitted. These controls format the receipt; they do not change sale prices, taxes or payment amounts.

Use **Live receipt preview** to see unsaved changes. **Test print (sample)** prints a clearly marked example and does not create a sale, payment or stock movement. Save when the preview is correct. Managers can inspect the settings and sample but cannot change the location's receipt configuration.

In cashier **Settings**, choose the **Printer paper width on this device** to match the printer: 80 mm or 58 mm. This choice is saved on that device/browser; it does not change another register's printer. Match the printer driver's paper setting too. Browser print preview and a successful physical print are separate checks.

These settings affect future receipts. They do not change the catalog product name.

New receipts use numbered item rows with quantity, unit price and line total. Cash received and Change are shown for cash payments. Saved receipts keep their original business details, logo, customer presentation and footer when reprinted after settings change. Older receipts retain their earlier layout. Available customer phone presentation may be masked by the customer source; the POS does not invent missing digits.

Managers may have read-only visibility depending on authorization.

## 36. Management System status

Management System status can show more diagnostic information than cashier System status.

It may include a collapsible **Technical detail** or Reference section.

Technical detail is for authorized management/support use. It should not be necessary for a cashier to finish an ordinary sale.

**Candidate Management:** Grey loading placeholders follow the Management page being opened: staff cards, location/register/device cards, return work items, or receipt editor/preview. They give way to actual results, an empty state or an error. They are not completed records and are not proof that the underlying service became faster.

Management requests must finish with a result or a clear timeout/error; a button should not remain stuck on Saving, Approving or Checking. A timeout does not prove that a change failed. Review the same saved record and the displayed result before trying again, particularly for approval, recovery or refund checks. Keep browser/POS saved data.

## 37. Activity log

The activity log records authorized management changes, such as who changed what and where.

Use it for:

- administration review;
- audit;
- support;
- investigating unexpected configuration changes.

Do not treat the activity log as a substitute for normal cashier instructions.

# PART D — SAFE OPERATION RULES

## 38. Never do these

Do not:

- press payment confirmation repeatedly;
- create a second payment while the first is still being checked;
- create a second return to work around an unresolved one;
- manually alter prices to imitate wholesale rules;
- clear browser/site data to fix a POS problem;
- share staff passwords;
- use another person's account;
- switch registers to bypass authorization;
- assume a printed receipt failure means the sale failed;
- manually repeat a completed cash/refund effect because the screen looks uncertain.

---

## 39. When to ask a manager

Ask a manager when:

- your account does not have access to the correct register;
- a return needs approval;
- a shift/cash difference requires review;
- a refund remains unresolved;
- the POS says work needs attention and you do not have permission to resolve it.

---

## 40. When to report a software problem

Report a problem when:

- a button does not do what the screen says;
- a completed sale remains in the active cart;
- a receipt preview is blank or prints the whole POS;
- an understandable date/time is not shown;
- the POS exposes raw technical details to a cashier;
- going offline makes the POS disappear or incorrectly signs out a previously verified staff session;
- a cart/product disappears after reconnect;
- a count/status is clearly inconsistent with what you did;
- the same action appears to create duplicate orders/payments/returns;
- a role can see or do something it should not.

Use the Testing Workbook format so the problem can be reproduced.


### Quote-context review candidate — 5 October 2026

This candidate is awaiting review; the shared tester link remains on its recorded testing revision. Changing the customer or location requires a price check for the current context. Pay must remain unavailable while that check is pending, even when the visible items and quantities are unchanged. Test that a delayed earlier response cannot restore the previous customer/location price or enable Pay. Continue using “Check price again” after a failed check; saved cart and recovery instructions are unchanged.
