# CETECH POS — Staff Testing & Acceptance Workbook

**Updated for this testing round:** 2 October 2026 — price-check timing and retry checks added.

**UI refinement candidate — 3 October 2026:** Additional guidance marked **Candidate UI** describes `ws1/ui-refinement-2026-10-03`. Use it only when the coordinator confirms that candidate in the Test Brief. This note does not mean the existing POS link has been updated.

**Read and understand the [current Test Brief](https://github.com/WB-DevWorld/cetech-pwa-pos/tree/ws3/quote-latency-2026-10-02/docs/staff/testing-2026-10-02/brief) first.**

**[Open the POS for this round](https://cetech-pos-staging-git-integration-9578df-wbdevworlds-projects.vercel.app)**

Use this same address when opening or installing the POS. If your installed POS already uses it and works, keep using it and preserve your saved work.

**Purpose:** Help staff test the POS systematically, not randomly.\
**Audience:** Cashiers, managers, owners/admins, and authorized support testers.\
**Rule:** Test the exact build recorded in the Test Brief. Do not mix results from different builds.

## Choose your testing modules

Use the current dated [Test Brief](https://github.com/WB-DevWorld/cetech-pwa-pos/tree/ws3/quote-latency-2026-10-02/docs/staff/testing-2026-10-02/brief) for the POS link and this round's rules.

One designated **Admin** sets up staff, registers, and devices in **M00**. Once your own setup works, choose any module whose starting needs are met. You do not have to complete the whole workbook from top to bottom. Two people can choose the same module using their own registers and test records.

Each tester needs a separate register for an independent shift. Separate accounts on the same register do not provide separate shifts. Each register's location also needs an active POS device. The Admin can test selling too, with a Cashier or Manager location role and their own assigned register.

Follow dependent steps inside a module in order. Record tests you cannot run as **COULD NOT TEST**, with the reason. Leave unattempted tests unmarked and list them in your handoff. A PASS needs the stated result, not just a screen opening.

| Choose | Module | Tests | Who / what you need before starting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [ ] | [M00 Team setup and Management](#m00--team-setup-and-management) | T130–T139 | Designated Admin; other role accounts only for the specific permission checks |
| [ ] | [M01 Sign-in and access](#m01--sign-in-and-access) | T01–T05 | Your account; T03 needs a new account; T05 needs a developer's controlled setup |
| [ ] | [M02 Register and shift](#m02--register-and-shift) | T10–T14 | Your assigned register and an active device; T11/T12/T14 need separate agreed setups |
| [ ] | [M03 Products and cart](#m03--products-and-cart) | T20–T25 | Saved/available products; T22 needs a scanner; T24 needs your completed sale; T25 needs a genuine out-of-date product list |
| [ ] | [M04 Customers and prices](#m04--customers-and-prices) | T30–T33 | Agreed test customers/products; your own shift for sale steps |
| [ ] | [M05 Cash sale](#m05--cash-sale) | T40–T42 | Your open shift, agreed test product, test cash; T42 needs controlled uncertainty |
| [ ] | [M06 Receipts and printing](#m06--receipts-and-printing) | T60–T63 | Your completed sale for T62; a fresh uninterrupted sale for T60/T61; Admin for T63 changes |
| [ ] | [M07 Orders](#m07--orders) | T70–T71 | Your completed order or an agreed view-only test order |
| [ ] | [M08 Returns](#m08--returns) | T80–T83 | Your fresh eligible test order; agreed safe case for T82; location Manager for T83 |
| [ ] | [M09 Attention and saved work](#m09--attention-and-saved-work) | T90–T92 | Safe existing unfinished test work; T92 needs two testers sharing one agreed browser |
| [ ] | [M10 Offline and reconnect](#m10--offline-and-reconnect) | T100–T104 | POS installed from the round's link; online sign-in and a saved cart first; run in order |
| [ ] | [M11 Saved cart](#m11--saved-cart) | T110–T111 | Your own safe unfinished cart and browser profile |
| [ ] | [M12 Settings and status](#m12--settings-and-status) | T120–T121 | Your Cashier account |
| [ ] | [M13 Screens and equipment](#m13--screens-and-equipment) | T140–T144 | Available computer/tablet/phone/scanner/printer; record missing equipment |
| [ ] | [M14 Shift close](#m14--shift-close) | T150–T151 | Your open shift, recorded test cash, and permission to close it or an agreed Manager helper |
| [ ] | [M15 Electronic payments](#m15--electronic-payments) | T50–T51 | Separate owner permission for that method and test; otherwise COULD NOT TEST |

At the end, complete [staff feedback](#staff-feedback) and submit your results plus every referenced image.

### Keep each person's work separate

- Use your own account, register, browser profile, cart, and test orders for ordinary testing.
- Do not close another person's shift or return their order.
- Do not change someone's access, register assignment, or shared settings while they are testing. Permission-change tests need an agreed helper and a separate test account.
- Admin does not automatically mean Manager. Return approvals and shift actions still need the right location role and permission.
- Shared-browser testing is the deliberate exception in T92. Preserve unfinished work and follow that test's instructions.
- Cash is the ordinary payment for this round. Appearance of another method is not permission to use it.
- Never use the protected historical refund case under issue #102 as a normal return test.
- If a sale, payment, refund, or stock result is uncertain, stop repeating that action and document it. Do not clear saved POS/browser data.

## 1. How to record every test

Make your own copy of this workbook and write your results in it.

For every test you perform, add this result block underneath that test:

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

At the top of your completed workbook, also record:

- Tester name:
- Date/time:
- Device:
- Browser / installed PWA:
- Test role:
- Test version/build shown in the Test Brief:
- Exact POS link used:
- Your location / register / selected POS device:
- Modules chosen:
- Tests not attempted or not finished, and why:

### Screenshots and photos

If the screen shows something important, unusual, confusing, or wrong, capture it where relevant.

You may either:

- embed the image directly in this Markdown file; or
- save it separately and write the exact filename/path in the result block.

Recommended screenshot folder:

`screenshots/`

Recommended filename format:

`<TEST-ID>-<short-description>-<number>.png`

Examples:

- `screenshots/T40-cash-sale-01.png`
- `screenshots/T61-blank-print-preview-01.png`
- `screenshots/T102-offline-reopen-01.png`

If you embed an image in Markdown, use the normal Markdown image format and point it to the exact screenshot file you submit.

Keep the screenshot filename/path unchanged after you reference it.

### What to submit

Save your completed workbook using:

`POS-Test-Results-YourName-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Save screenshots in a folder such as:

`POS-Test-Screenshots-YourName-YYYY-MM-DD/`

Then submit:

1. the completed Testing Workbook; and
2. the entire screenshot/photo folder containing every file referenced in the workbook.

Example:

- Workbook: `POS-Test-Results-Ama-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Screenshot: `POS-Test-Screenshots-Ama-YYYY-MM-DD/T61-blank-print-preview-01.png`

If you embed screenshots directly in the Markdown file, keep the referenced image files with the document so the images still open.

### A PASS means

The steps completed and the result matched the expected behavior.

### A FAIL means

The result did not match the expected behavior.

### PARTLY WORKED means

Some of the expected result worked, but something important was wrong.

### COULD NOT TEST means

The test was blocked by environment, access, configuration, hardware, or another known issue.

Do not mark a blocked test as PASS.

# M00 — Team setup and Management

**Before you start:** The designated Admin starts here. Use T136 to set up registers/devices before T131/T132 assigns new staff to them. Record the actual setup in your copy of the current Test Brief. Use spare agreed accounts for T133/T134/T135. Do not disable the working testers or change their assignments mid-test. T137 and T63 change settings others may share, so agree on the affected test location/register and record the previous settings. Restore the previous settings afterward only when no tester is still using the test change. Admin needs a separate Cashier/Manager location role for cashier/manager actions. T138 uses your own test shift or an agreed view-only shift.



## T130 — Management visibility by role

Test Owner/Admin/Manager/Support/Cashier.

**Expected:**
- Cashier: no Management control plane.
- Manager: only permitted management scope/locations.
- Support: diagnostic/audit scope only.
- Owner/Admin: organization control sections as authorized.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T131 — Add staff: create account now

Owner/Admin test.

**Do:** In Management → Staff & access, select Create account now. Enter the agreed Name and Email, create/generate a temporary password, choose Cashier at the test location, assign that person's own active register, and enable POS access after setup succeeds. Give the temporary password privately. Have the new staff member complete T03 and check Register under T13.

**Expected:**
- Name/Email validated;
- temporary password required;
- organization/location/register role can be set as allowed;
- access is not enabled if required setup fails;
- user must change temporary password at first sign-in.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T132 — Add staff: send invitation

**Do:** As Owner/Admin, use Send invitation for a separate agreed test account. The recipient checks the email, opens its setup link, completes account setup, and signs in through the current Test Brief link. Confirm their location/register assignments and enabled POS access before they try Register. Record delivery and account setup separately. Do not put the invitation link in screenshots or the workbook.

**Expected:**
- invitation is sent/queued successfully when environment supports it;
- invited staff cannot operate POS until assignments/access are completed.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\

## T133 — Disable POS access

**Expected:**
- disabled staff loses active POS sessions;
- cannot establish a new POS session;
- a new sign-in shows **Your POS access is disabled. Contact a manager.** and does not add a Reference line;
- audit/management record reflects the change.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\

## T134 — Role hierarchy

**Expected:**
- Admin cannot reset/control an Owner in ways reserved for Owner;
- at least one active Owner remains;
- Manager cannot grant themselves organization control.

## T135 — Manager register assignment

**Expected:**
- Manager may adjust register assignment only for staff already assigned to the manager's location;
- Manager cannot create a new location assignment or change the staff member's cashier/manager role unless explicitly authorized by the model.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\

## T136 — Locations / registers / devices

Owner/Admin test.

**Do:** Use Management → Locations, Registers, and Devices to set up separate test registers as directed. Check the agreed location and GHS before creating each register. Ensure its location has an active POS device. Record each tester's assignment in the Test Brief's working copy. Have each person verify Register with their own account. Use a spare test setup for inactive/no-device checks. Do not deactivate a location or device others are using.

**Expected:**
- add/update actions are scoped to organization;
- inactive location/register/device behavior is clear;
- a location without active POS device cannot open its register shift;
- register currency cannot be casually changed after creation.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\

## T138 — Shifts & cash management

**Expected:**
- X report is current/live;
- Z report is durable after close;
- cash correction reverses an existing entry rather than editing history;
- manager permissions are respected.

**Expected:**
- technical/support details are role-gated;
- activity log shows authorized management changes;
- cashier does not receive the same technical surface.

# M01 — Sign-in and access

**Before you start:** Use your own account. T03 pairs with the Admin's T131 or T132 setup. T04 needs a Cashier-only account. T05 is a separate specialist check and does not hold up ordinary testing.


## T01 — Normal staff sign-in

**Do:** Sign in with an authorized cashier account.

**Candidate UI check:** Before signing in, switch **Show** then **Hide** and confirm that the password is retained. Do not capture the revealed password in a screenshot.

**Expected:**
- sign-in succeeds;
- normal POS appears;
- correct staff identity is shown;
- only authorized work areas are available.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T02 — Wrong password

**Do:** Enter a wrong password once.

**Expected:**
- sign-in is rejected;
- message is understandable;
- the main message stays the ordinary wrong-password wording and does not add a Reference line;
- no technical/server error is shown as the main message;
- no account access is granted.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

---

## T03 — Temporary password change

**Do:** Use a test account that must change its temporary password.

**Expected:**
- normal POS remains closed until password is changed;
- the user can set and confirm a new password;
- after success, normal authorized POS access becomes available.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T04 — Cashier cannot enter Management

**Do:** Use a cashier-only account and try the normal UI/direct Management route if your test setup allows it.

**Expected:**
- Management controls are not shown to the cashier;
- direct unauthorized access fails closed.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T05 — Sign-in when a service is unavailable

**Developer-assisted test only.** Do not stop services, change connections, or alter accounts yourself. If the controlled setup is unavailable, record COULD NOT TEST.

**Do:**
1. Use an agreed test account while the developer creates a controlled service failure.
2. Attempt sign-in once. Record the time, the message, and any Reference shown.
3. Give the developer the Reference through the private test report. The developer checks that it identifies the matching failure in the service records.
4. After service is restored, try normal sign-in. Check a wrong password separately under T02.

**Expected:**
- a service problem is described as sign-in being unavailable, rather than an incorrect password or missing assignment;
- the Reference helps the developer find the same problem without exposing private information;
- normal sign-in works after restoration;
- a wrong password still has the ordinary wrong-password message, without a Reference.

# M02 — Register and shift

**Before you start:** Use your own assigned register at a location with an active device. One register supports one open/closing shift at a time. For T10, do not take over an existing shift. T11/T12 need spare test setups. T14 needs an agreed helper and must not change another active tester's assignment.


## T10 — Open assigned register

**Do:**
1. Open Register.
2. Select an assigned register.
3. Select the correct active device if asked.
4. Enter the test opening cash.
5. Open register.

**Expected:**
- one shift opens;
- correct register/location/device is shown;
- no duplicate shift is created.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T11 — No active device

**Do:** Use a test register/location with no active device, only if that test setup is available.

**Expected:**
- shift cannot open;
- message clearly explains that an active POS device is required.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T12 — Register outside staff assignment

**Do:** Attempt an out-of-scope register only if a safe out-of-scope test account/setup is available.

**Expected:**
- access is refused;
- staff is not locked out of their valid register;
- valid register remains selectable.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

---

## T13 — Cashier register access without organization Admin

**Do:** With a test account assigned Cashier at a location and assigned at least one register, sign in on a desktop and a phone. Confirm the account has no organization Owner/Admin/Support role. Open Register without opening a shift.

**Expected:**
- the assigned register choices appear on both devices;
- no organization Admin role is needed;
- registers outside the account's assignments are absent;
- record the exact test URL/build on each device.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T14 — Register assignment changes during a session

**Do:** In a controlled staging test, have an authorized manager add or remove a test register assignment for the signed-in cashier. Record the visible register choices before the change. Return to the POS tab or reconnect, then open Register and record the choices afterward. Do not open a shift for this check.

**Expected:**
- the list reflects the current assignment without granting an organization Admin role;
- a removed register can no longer be selected;
- if the session or assignment check fails, the POS asks for recovery instead of saying the cashier has no assigned register;
- no saved cart or pending work is cleared.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\

# M03 — Products and cart

**Before you start:** Use agreed training products. Record how quickly saved products appear after sign-in and whether the POS stays usable while products refresh. T24 uses your own completed sale from M05. T25 verifies the out-of-date → refresh → ready sequence; a fresh list alone does not prove it.


## T20 — Search product by name

**Do:** Search for a known staging product.

**Candidate UI check:** Switch **Grid**, **List**, and **Compact**. Check that products/prices and the current cart stay the same, and that your chosen view remains after a normal refresh. These are browser/device preferences.

**Expected:**
- correct product appears quickly;
- name/price presentation is readable.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\

## T21 — Long product name

**Do:** Find a product with a very long name.

**Expected:**
- compact screen layout remains usable;
- name is visually limited where appropriate;
- full product identity is not changed in the data/search behavior.

**Candidate UI check:** **List** wraps the full product name; keyboard focus expands a name in **Grid**. The cart also wraps full names. Verify these without changing or shortening the product data.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\

## T22 — Barcode scan

**Do:** Scan a known test barcode.

**Expected:**
- correct product/variation is found;
- scan does not add the wrong product.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\
**Other notes:**

## T23 — Quantity change

**Do:** Add an item, increase/decrease quantity, then remove it. Time each price check from the click until the total appears. Record the seconds or minutes for adding the item and changing its quantity.

**Expected:**
- quantity changes correctly;
- totals respond appropriately;
- the price check finishes without waiting several minutes; record the actual time, even if it eventually succeeds;
- removing the line removes it from the working cart.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\

## T24 — Completed cart lifecycle

**Do:** Complete a safe staging sale.

**Expected:**
- completed sale is no longer the active working cart;
- a new clean selling workspace is available;
- completed cart is not counted as another active/saved working cart;
- receipt remains available separately.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\
**What actually happened:**\
**Anything confusing:**\
**Screenshot/photo:** embedded image or exact filename/path\

## T25 — Refresh an out-of-date product list

**Starting need:** The POS already shows that saved products may be out of date. Do not change product data or delete saved products to force this condition. If it is unavailable, record COULD NOT TEST.

**Do:**
1. Capture the out-of-date product message and the product status in Settings → System status.
2. With internet restored, use the available Refresh products or Try again action for that warning. If that action is restricted to Management, work with the Admin and record which role used it.
3. Record the message during the refresh and afterward, including how long it took.
4. Check the warning and product status again. Search for a known saved product.

**Expected:**
- saved products remain usable for safe browsing while refresh runs;
- a successful refresh changes the product status to ready and clears the out-of-date warning;
- a failed refresh keeps an honest warning and does not claim the products are up to date;
- the cart and unfinished work remain saved;
- refreshing products does not bypass the fresh price check before payment.

# M04 — Customers and prices

**Before you start:** Use agreed training customers and products. A price shown on a saved product is not the final payment price. Complete sale steps only with your own open shift and cash testing permission.


## T30 — Walk-in sale

**Do:** Prepare a normal walk-in sale. Record how long the price takes to appear. If a price check fails and **Check price again** appears, select it once and record the result. Do not deliberately break a service to force this condition.

**Expected:**
- Walk-in works without selecting a customer account;
- the price appears promptly; record the actual wait;
- after a failed check, retry keeps the same products and quantities and does not create a payment or sale;
- Pay stays unavailable until a valid price is ready.

Record the retry part as **COULD NOT TEST** if no failed check or retry button is available. A several-minute wait is a failure to report, even if the price eventually appears.

**Do:** Select an approved B2B/wholesale test customer.

**Expected:**
- Wholesale is shown;
- authoritative price is returned;
- cashier is not asked to manually calculate wholesale pricing.

**Do:** Only if an unavailable-customer-search test condition is available.

**Expected:**
- message is understandable;
- Walk-in remains available where safe;
- no fake customer data appears.

# M05 — Cash sale

**Before you start:** Open your own shift first. Use an agreed small training sale and test cash. T41 is the deliberate double-confirmation check and must not create a second transaction. T42 needs a safe controlled case; do not repeatedly interrupt ordinary sales to force it. For the first-receipt check, use a separate normal T40 sale and go straight to T60/T61 without reloading, signing out, or going offline.


## T40 — Normal cash sale

**Do:**
1. add product;
2. confirm customer;
3. wait for Price ready;
4. Pay;
5. choose Cash;
6. confirm once.

**Expected:**
- exactly one sale/order is completed;
- correct total is recorded;
- receipt is created;
- sale appears in Orders.

### Your result

**Result:** PASS / FAIL / PARTLY WORKED / COULD NOT TEST\

## T41 — Double-click / repeated cash confirmation

**Do:** Only in the test environment. Attempt the same confirmation twice or repeat after a slow response.

**Expected:**
- no duplicate order;
- no duplicate cash payment;
- existing transaction is reused/resolved.

## T42 — Slow/uncertain completion

**Do:** When a controlled test produces uncertainty.

**Expected:**
- POS keeps the same transaction;
- message tells staff what to do;
- no instruction to charge again;
- recovery checks the existing transaction;
- if the sale was not created, the cart stays and another Pay starts only after that attempt is cleared;
- if the result is still unknown, the message is **This needs manual review. Contact a manager or support.** and Pay does not start a second sale;
- if the register says an existing order cannot yet be opened for payment, staff leave that order and ask a manager instead of starting another sale;
- if payment was already submitted, staff do not charge again;
- if the sale is complete but the official receipt is missing, staff contact a manager and do not take payment again.

# M06 — Receipts and printing

**Before you start:** For T60/T61, complete a fresh T40 cash sale and inspect/print its first receipt immediately. Do not reload, sign out, go offline, or use recovery first. Record the human location/register name, date/time, items and total. If interrupted, record that separately and do not count it as uninterrupted first-receipt proof. T62 then reprints the same stored receipt from Orders. An older receipt proves reprint only. A print-preview screenshot and a physical printer result are separate evidence. T63 changes need Owner/Admin; a Manager can check the permitted view.


## T60 — Completed-sale receipt

**Do:** Complete a staging sale and view the receipt.

**Expected:**
- receipt has understandable date/time;
- product/variation text is readable;
- totals are correct;
- no prominent raw technical/debug block appears on the customer receipt.

## T61 — Print receipt

**Do:** Select Print receipt.

**Expected:**
- browser print preview shows the actual receipt;
- preview is not blank;
- preview is an 80mm-wide page, not A4 or Letter and not the full POS screen;
- the printer itself must be set to an 80mm roll. The page does not grow with the receipt.

- reprint does not create another sale;
- current catalog/settings changes do not rewrite the historic receipt.

## T63 — Receipt name/SKU settings

Owner/Admin changes; Manager view-only.

**Do:** In Management → Receipt settings, use a safe test location and adjust settings as authorized.

**Expected:**
- shortening changes future receipt display only;
- catalog product name stays unchanged;
- Show SKU affects receipt presentation;
- historic receipts remain unchanged.

# M07 — Orders

**Before you start:** Use your own completed order, or an agreed view-only order. Record its displayed order number and test time so the result can be matched later. Do not return or change another tester's order.


## T70 — Search Orders

**Do:** Search by order, receipt, customer, or transaction reference.

**Expected:**
- expected sale is found;
- displayed date/time is understandable.

**Candidate UI check:** If loading is visible, placeholder rows give way to actual results or an honest empty/error message. Search/status controls remain reachable, and the page does not need sideways scrolling on a phone. Record when loading was too quick to observe.

## T71 — Open order detail

**Expected:**
- customer, payment, total, items, and status are readable;
- Reprint and Return items appear when allowed;
- technical reference information is secondary/collapsible.

**Candidate UI check:** Full item names wrap. In a long order, scroll the details while permitted actions remain visible at the bottom. With a keyboard, check Tab/Shift+Tab stays in the dialog, Escape closes it, and focus returns to the order button. Opening/closing the dialog must not start a return or print a receipt.

# M08 — Returns

**Before you start:** Use your own fresh eligible test order for return execution. Once a return starts, keep that same return until its result is clear. T82 needs an agreed safe case and is view-only unless a separate action is explicitly authorized. The old issue #102 refund case is excluded. T83 needs an operational Manager at the location; organization Admin alone is insufficient.


## T80 — Normal return

**Candidate UI check:** You may find the same eligible sale in Returns by entering an order/customer/receipt and choosing **Search sales** (or pressing Enter). Full item names should wrap. An unresolved return must still hide/lock other sales; continue that return instead of starting a new one.

**Do:**
1. start Return items from an eligible order;
2. select item/quantity;
3. enter reason;
4. select condition;
5. Review return;
6. Complete return.

**Expected:**
- summary matches what was selected;
- refund amount is understandable;
- completion status is clear.

## T82 — Return needs attention

**Do:** Use an existing safe requires-attention return if one is available.

**Expected:**
- the screen clearly separates what has already completed from what still needs review;
- if **Cash refund already completed** is shown, the cashier is clearly told not to refund the customer again;
- if **Order refund needs review** is shown, the cashier is clearly told not to create another order refund for the same return;
- if **Stock update is not settled yet** is shown, the cashier is clearly told not to adjust stock manually while the return is still being checked;
- the same existing return remains the thing to review instead of starting another one;
- raw internal IDs are not prominent;
- manager/support action is clearly separated from normal cashier action.

## T83 — Manager return approval

Manager test only.

**Expected:**

- approval does not itself create a second refund or stock change.

# M09 — Attention and saved work

**Before you start:** Use agreed safe unfinished work. Viewing a notice is different from retrying a financial action. T91 checks that offline recovery is blocked. T92 is the deliberate shared-browser exception and needs two testers plus a safe unknown-result case.


## T90 — Attention list

**Expected:**
- outstanding work is understandable;
- operator sees a clear next action;
- already-completed effects are not repeated.

## T92 — Another person signs into the same browser

**Two-person, controlled test only.** Use the same browser profile and exact POS link for A and B. A developer must provide or help create a safe case where A's sale result is genuinely unknown. An ordinary saved cart is not enough. Do not deliberately interrupt a real payment or use the protected case under issue #102. If a safe case is unavailable, record COULD NOT TEST.

**Do:**
1. A signs in and uses A's assigned register. Capture the agreed unfinished sale and the message saying its result is not known.
2. A signs out normally without clearing browser data or saved POS work.
3. B signs into that same browser profile using B's own account. Capture any unfinished-work notice before taking another action.
4. B checks their own assigned register. Do not pay or refund A's sale, or start a replacement sale for it.
5. An authorized Manager/support helper checks whether A's unresolved work makes the shared register/device unsafe. Record the allowed next step. Do not assume B must always be allowed to sell.

**Expected:**
- A's unfinished work is preserved;
- B is not told that B created A's sale;
- B does not gain access to resolve A's work merely by signing in;
- B's selling is blocked if the unresolved work makes the shared register/device unsafe, with an understandable explanation;
- unrelated safe work is not blocked solely because a different person left work in that browser;
- authorized review of the existing work remains possible, without another sale/payment/refund or clearing browser data.

# M10 — Offline and reconnect

**Before you start:** Run T100 → T101 → T102 → T103 → T104 in that order on the POS installed from the current brief's exact link. Record device, browser/PWA, times, and the saved cart before disconnecting. Before T100, install and open it online so the app and safe local products are saved. Do not clear data. Reconnecting must check current permission again. An ordinary browser-tab test does not prove installed-PWA cold start. The developer should help arrange an additional pass across online-session expiry while still inside the permitted offline period. Record that boundary condition separately; a quick offline reopen does not close that part of #114.


These are high-value tests. Follow the exact sequence.

## T100 — Online baseline

**Do:**
1. sign in online;
2. confirm correct register/shift;
3. add a safe product to cart;
4. note the exact build.

**Expected:** normal online operation.

- valid last-verified cashier/register presentation remains visible while permitted;
- current cart remains;
- safe local products remain accessible.

## T103 — Offline commercial actions blocked

While offline, attempt only the safe checks described in this workbook.

**Expected blocked until connection:**
- Pay / fresh authoritative price;
- Returns execution/resolve;
- Attention recovery;
- register-changing actions.

The POS must not pretend those actions succeeded.

# M11 — Saved cart

**Before you start:** Use your own browser profile and unfinished test cart. Reloading must preserve that work. Do not clear browser data as part of this module.


## T110 — One active working cart

**Do:** Start/complete multiple controlled sales and observe current cart state.

**Expected:**
- one current active working cart;
- completed/discarded carts are retired appropriately;
- System status does not treat every historical local draft as an active cart.

# M12 — Settings and status

**Before you start:** Use Cashier-only access to check what ordinary staff see. Technical Management screens are checked separately under M00.


## T120 — Settings

**Expected:**
- device/register/scanner/printer information is understandable;
- theme can be changed where enabled;

# M13 — Screens and equipment

**Before you start:** Choose the equipment you actually have. For computer/tablet/phone, check both cashier screens and, with the authorized account, Management. Record unavailable equipment as COULD NOT TEST. Changing device does not let you open a second independent shift on the same register.


## T140 — Desktop

Test selling, modal dialogs, Orders, Returns, Register, and Management where authorized.

**Candidate UI check:** Confirm the compact navigation, clear loading placeholders, and routine messages leave search/cart/payment controls usable. Check long customer and item names without changing the stored data. Record the selected Grid/List/Compact view.

**Expected:** no hidden/overlapping critical controls.

**Expected:** layout remains usable; navigation/actions do not require desktop width.

**Candidate UI check:** Reach each labelled work area in the bottom navigation (swipe the navigation when needed). Confirm the working register is readable, cart/Pay controls remain reachable, and Orders/Customers/Returns/Register do not force the whole page sideways. Also check with the on-screen keyboard open. If safe existing work needs review, confirm the **Needs attention** shortcut and count remain visible without scrolling the navigation; do not create uncertain work just to force this condition.

# M14 — Shift close

**Before you start:** You can choose this module as soon as your own test shift is ready to close; you need not wait for everybody else. Count the recorded test cash. If policy requires a Manager, use an agreed helper with that location role rather than granting Admin to the Cashier. Never close another tester's shift. Finish any uncertain work on your own shift through the safe review path before closing.


## T150 — Zero-variance close

Manager/authorized-role test.

**Do:** Count the exact physical staging drawer cash and close according to policy.

**Expected:**
- counted amount accepted;
- expected amount shown after count;
- variance GHS 0.00 when counts match;
- shift closes once;
- exactly one durable Z report exists.

# M15 — Electronic payments

**Before you start:** This module is not enabled for ordinary testing in this round. Record T50/T51 as COULD NOT TEST unless the owner separately authorizes the specific method and test. Seeing a payment option does not give permission to use it.


Only run these tests when the owner has authorized that payment method and the specific test.

## T50 — Method availability

**Expected:**
- only configured methods are shown as available;
- Mobile Money and Card are independently enabled;
- a provider credential alone does not make a method appear usable.

# Staff feedback


After structured testing, ask every tester:

1. What was confusing?
2. What took too many clicks?
3. What wording did you not understand?
4. What did you expect to happen that did not happen?
5. What happened that you did not expect?
6. Which part felt slow?
7. Did you ever feel unsure whether a sale/payment/refund had already happened?
8. Was anything technical shown that a normal cashier should not see?
9. Was anything important hidden from you?
10. Would you feel safe using this with a real customer? Why or why not?

Do not replace the structured tests with free-form feedback. Use both.
