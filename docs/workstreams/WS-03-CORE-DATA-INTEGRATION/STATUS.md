| CP-04 | DEVELOPMENT BASELINE SATISFIED; write-safety/cutover OPEN / DEFERRED | ADR-011; authenticated audit preserved. Remaining actions in docs/runbooks/CP-04-REMAINING-WORK.md. Isolation NOT PROVEN; email UNSAFE for affected remote tests. No new write tests. |
| CP-05 | MERGED / VERIFIED | PR #32; merge `095696f15cd64b546003bc5c77b4600af7bc4c76`; @Ben-001-sys APPROVED; issue #5 CLOSED / COMPLETED |
| CI-01 | MERGED / VERIFIED; lease RELEASED | PR #38; merge `8e058d679bb02e96374c0e79cc32d025b6a9ed03`; @Ben-001-sys APPROVED |
| CORE-01 | Development prerequisites SATISFIED; implementation/review in PR #40 | CP-04 development baseline + CP-05 satisfied. Local schema/RLS needs no production Woo access. Do not recreate the submitted implementation. |
| CORE-02 | SPECIFIED | See TASKS.md; GitHub mapping in ../../plans/TASK-INDEX.md |
| CORE-03 | SPECIFIED | See TASKS.md; GitHub mapping in ../../plans/TASK-INDEX.md |

| REL-01 | SPECIFIED | See TASKS.md; GitHub mapping in ../../plans/TASK-INDEX.md |

CP-05, CI-01 and the merged CP-04 audit leases are released. This documentation reconciliation does not claim CORE-01 migration scope. Development readiness is the explicit senior decision in ADR-011; it does not change the NOT PROVEN remote-write isolation finding.
