CORE-01 holds the **CORE-01 lease** (`supabase/**`, DATA-OWNERSHIP, RLS tests, plus this pass's bounded Linux CI Supabase gate and RLS mirror tooling test). CP-05, CI-01 and the merged CP-04 audit leases remain released. Issue #4 stays OPEN as the live/cutover tracker. ADR-011 controls development gating; it does not change the NOT PROVEN remote-write isolation finding. Update with actual evidence; never mark a prerequisite fulfilled from a task specification.
